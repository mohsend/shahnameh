<p>
Five hundred years did Feridoun rule the world, and might and virtue 
increased in the land, and all his days he did that which was good. And he 
roamed throughout the kingdom to seek out that which was open and that which was 
hid, and wrong was righted at his hands. With kindness did he curb the sway of 
evil. He ordered the world like to a paradise, he planted the cypress and the 
rose where the wild herb had sprouted.   
<p>Now after many years were passed there were born to him three sons, whose 
mother was of the house of Jemshid. And the sons were fair of mien, tall and 
strong, yet their names were not known to men, for Feridoun had not tested their 
hearts. But when he beheld that they were come to years of strength he called 
them about his throne and bade them search out the King of Yemen, who had three 
daughters, fair as the moon, that they should woo them unto themselves. And the 
sons of Feridoun did according to the command of their father. They set forth 
unto Yemen, and there went with them a host countless as the stars. And when 
they were come to Yemen, the King came forth to greet them, and his train was 
like to the plumage of a pheasant. Then the sons of Feridoun gained the hands of 
the daughters of Serv, King of Yemen, and departed with them to their own land. 
And Serv gave to his new sons much treasure laid upon the backs of camels, and 
umbrellas too did he give unto them in sign of kingship.   
<p>Now it came about that when Feridoun learned that his sons were returning, he 
went forth to meet them and prove their hearts. So he took upon him the form of 
a dragon that foamed at the mouth with fury, and from whose jaws sprang mighty 
flames. And when his sons were come near unto the mountain pass, he came upon 
them suddenly, like to a whirlwind, and raised a cloud of dust about the place 
with his writhings, and his roaring filled the air with noise. Then he threw 
himself upon the eldest born, and the prince laid down his spear and said, "A 
wise and prudent man striveth not with dragons." And he turned his back and fled 
before the monster, and left him to fall upon his brothers. Then the dragon 
sprang upon the second, and he said, "An it be that I must fight, what matter if 
it be a furious lion or a knight full of valour?" So he took his bow and 
stretched it. But the youngest came towards him, and seeing the dragon, said, 
"Thou reptile, flee from our presence, and strut not in the path of lions. For 
if thou hast heard the name of Feridoun, beware how thou doest thus, for we are 
his sons, armed with spears and ready for the fight. Quit therefore, I counsel 
thee, thine evil path, lest I plant upon thy head the crown of enmity."   
<p>Then the glorious Feridoun, when he had thus made trial of their hearts, 
vanished from their sight. But presently he came again with the face of their 
father, and many warriors, elephants, and cymbals were in his train. And 
Feridoun bore in his hand the cow-headed mace, and the Kawanee, the apron of 
Kawah, the kingly standard, was waved above his head. Now when the sons saw 
their father, they alighted from their steeds and ran to greet him, and kissed 
the ground before his feet. And the cymbals were clashed, and the trumpets 
brayed, and sounds of rejoicing were heard around. Then Feridoun raised his sons 
and kissed their foreheads, and gave unto them honour according to their due. 
And when they were come to the royal house he prayed to God that He would bless 
his offspring, and calling them about him, he seated them upon thrones of 
splendour. Then he opened his mouth and said unto them-   
<p>"O my sons, listen unto the words that I shall speak. The raging dragon whose 
breath was danger was but your father, who sought to test your hearts, and 
having learned them gave way with joy. But now will I give to you names such as 
are fitting unto men. The first-born shall be called Silim (may thy desires be 
accomplished in the world!) for thou soughtest to save thyself from the clutches 
of the dragon, nor didst thou hesitate in the hour of flight. A man who fleeth 
neither before an elephant nor a lion, call him rather foolhardy than brave. And 
the second, who from the beginning showed his courage, which was ardent as a 
flame, I will call him Tur, the courageous, whom even a mad elephant cannot 
daunt. But the youngest is a man prudent and brave, who knoweth both how to 
haste and how to tarry; he chose the midway between the flame and the ground, as 
it beseemeth a man of counsel, and he hath proven himself brave, prudent, and 
bold. Irij shall he be called, that the gate of power may be his goal, for first 
did he show gentleness, but his bravery sprang forth at the hour of danger."   
<p>When Feridoun had thus opened his lips he called for the book wherein are 
written the stars, and he searched for the planets of his sons. And he found 
that Jupiter reigned in the sign of the Archer in the house of Silim, and the 
sun in the Lion in that of Tur, but in the house of Irij there reigned the moon 
in the Scorpion. And when he saw this he was sorrowful, for he knew that for 
Irij were grief and bale held in store. Then having read the secrets of Fate, 
Feridoun parted the world and gave the three parts unto his sons in suzerainty. 
Roum and Khaver, which are the lands of the setting sun, did he give unto Silim. 
Turan and Turkestan did he give unto Tur, and made him master of the Turks and 
of China, but unto Irij he gave Iran, with the throne of might and the crown of 
supremacy.   
<p>For many years had the sons of Feridoun sat upon their golden thrones in 
happiness and peace, but evil was hidden in the bosom of Fate. For Feridoun had 
grown old, and his strength inclined to the grave. And as his life waned, the 
evil passions of his sons waxed stronger. The heart of Silim was changed, and 
his desires turned towards evil; his soul also was steeped in greed. And he 
pondered in his spirit the parting of the lands, and he revolted thereat in his 
thoughts, because that the youngest bore the crown of supremacy. Then he bade a 
messenger mount him upon a dromedary swift of foot, and bear this saying unto 
Tur-   
<p>"O King of Turan, thy brother greeteth thee, and may thy days be long in the 
land. Tell unto me, I pray thee, for thou hast might and wisdom, should we 
remain thus ever satisfied, for surely unto us, not unto Irij, pertaineth the 
throne of Iran, but now is our brother set above our heads, and should we not 
strive against the injustice of our father? "   
<p>Now. when Tur had listened to these words, his head was filled with wind, and 
he spake unto the messenger and said-   
<p>"Say unto your master, O my brother, full of courage, since our father 
deceived us when we were young and void of guile, with his own hands hath he 
planted a tree whence must issue fruit of blood and leaves that are poison. Let 
us therefore meet and take counsel together how we may rid us of our evil 
fate."   
<p>When Silim heard this he set forth from Roum, and Tur also quitted China, and 
they met to counsel together how they should act. Then they sent a messenger 
unto Feridoun the glorious, and they said-   
<p>"O King, aged and great, fearest thou not to go home unto thy God? for evil 
hast thou done, and injustice dost thou leave behind thee. Thy realm hast thou 
allotted with iniquity, and thine eldest born hast thou treated with disfavour. 
But we thy sons entreat thee that ere it be too late thou listen to our voice. 
Command thou Irij to step down from the throne of Iran, and hide him in some 
corner of the earth, that he be weak and forgotten like ourselves. Yet if thou 
doest not our bidding, we will bring forth riders from Turkestan and Khaver 
filled with vengeance, and will utterly destroy Irij and the land of Iran."   
<p>When Feridoun had listened to these hard words he was angered, and 
straightway said-   
<p>"Speak unto these men, senseless and impure, these sons of Ahriman, perverse 
of heart, and say unto them, Feridoun rejoiceth that ye have laid bare before 
him your hearts, for now he knoweth what manner of men ye are. And he answereth 
unto you that he hath parted his realm with equity. Many counsellors did he 
seek, and night and day did they ponder it, and gave unto each that which seemed 
best in their sight. And he now speaketh unto you a word that he doth bid you 
treasure in your hearts, As ye sow, so also shall ye reap, for there is for us 
another, an eternal home. And this is the rede sent unto you by an aged man, 
that he who betrayeth his brother for greed is not worthy to be sprung from a 
noble race. So pray unto God that He turn your hearts from evil."   
<p>When the messenger had heard these words he departed. Then Feridoun called 
Irij before him and warned him against the craft of his brethren, and bade him 
prepare an army and go forth to meet them. But Irij, when he had heard of the 
evil thoughts of his brothers, was moved, and said-   
<p>"Not so, O my father, suffer that I go forth alone and speak unto my 
brethren, that I may still the anger that they feel against me. And I will 
entreat them that they put not their trust in the glory of this world, and will 
recall unto them the name of Jemshid, and how that his end was evil because that 
he was uplifted in his heart."   
<p>Then Feridoun answered and said, "Go forth, my son, if such be thy desire. 
The wish of thy brethren is even unto war, but thou seekest the paths of peace. 
Yet I pray thee take with thee worthy knights, and return unto me with speed, 
for my life is rooted in thy happiness."   
<p>And he gave him a letter signed with his royal seal that he should bear it 
unto the kings of Roum and China. And Feridoun wrote how that he was old, and 
desired neither gold nor treasures, save only that his sons should be united. 
And he commended unto them his youngest born, who was descended from his throne 
and come forth to meet them with peace in his heart.   
<p>Now when Irij was come to the spot where his brethren were encamped, the army 
saw him and was filled with wonder at his beauty and at his kingly form, and 
they murmured among themselves, saying, "Surely this one alone is worthy to bear 
the sceptre." But when Silim and Tur heard this murmur their anger was deepened, 
and they retreated into their tents, and all night long did they hold counsel 
how they might do hurt unto their brother.   
<p>Now when the curtain that hid the sun was lifted, the brethren went forth 
unto the tents of Irij. And Irij would have greeted them, but they suffered him 
not, but straightway began to question him, and heap reproaches upon his head. 
And Tur said-   
<p>"Why hast thou uplifted thyself above us, and is it meet that thy elders bow 
down before thee?"   
<p>When Irij heard their words, he answered, "O Kings greedy of power, I say 
unto you, if ye desire happiness, strive after peace. I covet neither the royal 
crown nor the hosts of Iran; power that endeth in discord is an honour that 
leadeth to tears. And I will step down from the throne of Iran if it shall 
foster peace between us, for I crave not the possession of the world if ye are 
afflicted by the sight. For I am humble of heart, and my faith bids me be 
kind."   
<p>Now Tur heard these words, but they softened not his spirit, for he knew only 
that which is evil, and wist not that Irij spoke truly. And he took up the chair 
whereon he sat and threw it at his brother in his anger. Then Irij called for 
mercy at his hands, saying-   
<p>"O King, hast thou no fear of God, no pity for thy father? I pray thee 
destroy me not, lest God ask vengeance for my blood. Let it not be spoken that 
thou who hast life takest that gift from others. Do not this evil. Crush not 
even the tiny ant that beareth a grain of corn, for she hath life, and sweet 
life is a boon. I will vanish from thy sight, I will live in solitude and 
secrecy, so thou grant that I may yet behold the sun."   
<p>But these words angered Tur only the more, and he drew from his boot a dagger 
that was poisoned and sharp, and he thrust it into the breast of Irij, the 
kingly cedar. And the young lord of the world paled and was dead. Then Tur cut 
the head from the trunk, and filled it with musk and ambergris, and sent it unto 
the old man his father, who had parted the world, saying-   
<p>"Behold the head of thy darling, give unto him now the crown and the 
throne."   
<p>And when they had done this evil deed the brethren furled their tents, and 
turned them back again unto the lands of Roum and Cathay.   
<p>Now Feridoun held his eyes fastened upon the road whither Irij was gone, and 
his heart yearned after him. And when he heard that the time of his return was 
come, he bade a host go forth to meet him, and he himself went in the wake. Now 
when they were gone but a little way they beheld a mighty cloud of dust upon the 
sky. And the cloud neared, and there came thence a dromedary whereon was seated 
a knight clad in the garb of woe. And he bare in his arms a casket of gold, and 
in the casket were rich stuffs of silk, and in the stuffs was wrapped the head 
of Irij. And when Feridoun beheld the face of the messenger his heart was smote 
with fear, but when he saw the head of his son he fell from his horse with 
sorrow. Then a cry of wailing rent the air, and the army shouted for grief, and 
the flags were torn, and the drums broken, and the elephants and cymbals hung 
with the colours of mourning, because that Irij was gone from the world. And 
Feridoun returned on foot unto the city, and all the nobles went with him, and 
they retraced their steps in the dust. Now when they were come to the garden of 
Irij, Feridoun faltered in his sorrow, and he pressed the head of the young 
King, his son, unto his breast. And he cast black earth upon his throne, and 
tore his hair, and shed tears, and his cries mounted even unto the seventh 
sphere. And he spake in his grief and said-   
<p>"O Master of the world, that metest out justice, look down, I pray thee, upon 
this innocent whom his brethren have foully murdered! Sear their hearts that joy 
cannot enter, and grant unto me my prayer. Suffer that I may live until a hero, 
a warrior mighty to avenge, be sprung from the seed of Irij. Then when I shall 
have beheld his face I will go hence as it beseemeth me and the earth shall 
cover my body."   
<p>Thus wept Feridoun in the bitterness of his soul, neither would he take 
comfort day and night, nor quit the garden of his son. And the earth was his 
couch and the dust his bed, and he watered the ground with his tears. And he 
rested in this spot till that the grass was grown above his bosom, and his eyes 
were blinded with weeping. Yet his tongue did not cease from plaining and his 
heart from sorrow. And he cried continually-   
<p>"O Irij, O my son, my son, never prince died a death like thine! Thy head was 
severed by Ahriman, thy body torn by lions."   
<p>Thus mourned Feridoun, and the voice of lamentation was abroad.   
<p>Then it came about that after many years had passed Feridoun bethought him of 
the daughter of Irij, and how that men said she was fair. And he sought for her 
in the house of the women; and when he learned that she was fair indeed, he 
desired that a husband be found for her, and he wedded her unto Pescheng, who 
was a hero of the race of Jemshid. And there was born unto them a son fair and 
strong, worthy the throne. And when he was yet but a tender babe they brought 
him to Feridoun and cried-   
<p>"O Lord of earth, let thy soul rejoice, behold this Irij!"   
<p>Then the lips of Feridoun were wreathed with smiles, and he took up the 
infant in his arms and cried unto God, saying-   
<p>"O God, grant that my sight be restored unto me, that I may behold the face 
of this babe."   
<p>And as he prayed his eyes were opened, and his sight rested upon his son. 
Then Feridoun gave thanks unto God. And he called down blessings upon the child, 
and prayed that the day might be blessed also, and the heart of his enemies be 
torn with anguish. And he named him Minuchihr, saying, "A branch worthy of a 
noble stock hath borne fruit." And the child was reared in the house of 
Feridoun, and he suffered not that ill came near unto him, and though the years 
passed above his head the stars brought him no evil. And when he was of a ripe 
age Feridoun gave to Minuchihr a throne of gold, and a mace, and a crown of 
jewels, and the key to all his treasures. Then he commanded his nobles that they 
should do him reverence and salute him king. And there were gathered about the 
throne Karun, the son of Kawah, and Serv, King of Yemen, and Guerschasp the 
victorious, and many other mighty princes more than tongue can name. But the 
young Shah outshone them in strength and beauty, and joy was once more in the 
land.   
<p>But tidings of the splendour that surrounded Feridoun pierced even unto the 
lands of Roum and China, and the kings thereof were troubled and downcast in 
their hearts. Then they conferred how they should regain the favour of the Shah, 
for they feared Minuchihr when he should be come unto years of might. So they 
sent a messenger unto Feridoun bearing rich gifts, and bade him speak unto their 
father and say-   
<p>"O Shah, live for ever I bear a message from the humblest of thy slaves, who 
are bowed unto the earth with contrition, wherefore they have not ventured into 
thy presence. And they pray that thou pardon their evil deed, for their hearts 
are good, and they did it not of themselves, but because it was written that 
they should do this wrong, and that which is written in the stars surely it is 
accomplished. And therefore, O King, their eyes are filled with tears, and they 
pray thee incline unto them thine ear. And as a sign of thy grace send unto them 
Minuchihr thy son, for their hearts yearn to look upon his face and do him 
homage."   
<p>Now when Feridoun had listened to the words of his sons, he knitted his brows 
in anger, for he knew that they sought only to beguile him. And he said unto the 
messenger-   
<p>"Go, say unto your masters that their false-hearted words shall avail them 
nothing. And ask them if they be not shamed to utter white words with tongues of 
blackness. I have heard their message, hear now the answer that I send. Ye say 
unto me that ye desire the love of Minuchihr, and I ask of you, What did ye for 
Irij? And now that ye are delivered of him ye seek the blood of his son. Verily 
I say unto you, never shall ye look upon his face save when he leadeth a mighty 
army. Then shall be watered with blood the leaves and fruits of the tree sprung 
from the vengeance that is due. For unto this day hath vengeance slumbered, 
since it became me not to stretch forth mine hand in battle upon my sons; but 
now is there sprung a branch from the tree which the enemy uprooted, and he 
shall come as a raging lion, girt with the vengeance of his sire. And I say unto 
you, take back the treasures ye have sent me, for think ye that for coloured 
toys I will abandon my vengeance, and efface for baubles the blood that ye have 
spilled, or sell for gold the head of mine offspring? And say yet again that 
while the father of Irij lives he will not abandon his intent. And now that thou 
hast listened unto my message, lay it up in thy heart and make haste from 
hence."   
<p>When the messenger had heard these words he departed with speed. And when he 
was come unto Silim and Tur he told them thereof, and how he had seen Minuchihr 
sitting upon a throne of gold, and how for strength he was like unto Tahumers, 
who had bound the Devs. And he told how heroes bearing names that filled the 
world with wonder stood round about him, Kawah the smith, and Karun his son, and 
Serv, the King of Yemen, and next in might unto the Shah was Saum, the son of 
Neriman, the unvanquished in fight, and Guerschasp the victorious, his 
treasurer. Then he spake of the treasures that filled the house of Feridoun, and 
of the army great in number, so that the men of Roum and China could not stand 
against them. And he told how their hearts were filled with hatred of the Kings 
because of Irij.   
<p>The Kings, when they heard this and the message of their father, trembled for 
fear. And Tur said unto Silim-   
<p>"Henceforth we must forego pleasure, for it behoveth us to hasten, and not 
tarry till the teeth of this young lion be sharpened, and he be waxed tall and 
strong."   
<p>Then they made ready their armies, and the number of their men was past the 
counting. Helmet was joined to helmet, and spear to spear, and jewels, baggage, 
and elephants without number went with them, and you would have said it was a 
host that none could understand. And they marched from Turan into Iran, and the 
two Kings rode before them, their hearts filled with hate. But the star of these 
evil ones was sinking. For Feridoun, when he learned that an army had crossed 
the Jihun, called unto him Minuchihr his son, and bade him place himself at the 
head of the warriors. And the host of the Shah was mighty to behold, great and 
strong, and it covered the land like unto a cloud of locusts. And they marched 
from Temmische unto the desert, and Minuchihr commanded them with might. And on 
his right rode Karun the Avenger, and on his left Saum, the son of Neriman, and 
above their heads waved the flag of Kawah, and their armour glistened in the 
sun. Like as a lion breaketh forth from the jungle to seize upon his prey, so 
did this army rush forth to avenge the death of Irij. And the head of Minuchihr 
rose above the rest like to the moon or the sun when it shineth above the 
mountains. And he exhorted them in words of fire that they rest not, neither 
weary, until they should have broken the power of these sons of Ahriman.   
<p>Now Tur and Silim, when they saw that the Iranians were come out against 
them, set in order their army. And when the day had torn asunder the folds of 
night, the two armies met in battle, and the fight waged strong until the 
setting of the sun. And the earth was a sea of blood, and the feet of the 
elephants were like to pillars of coral. And when the sun was sunk to his rest, 
Tur and Silim consulted how they might seize upon Minuchihr by fraud, for they 
saw that his arm was strong and his courage undaunted. So Tur set forth at the 
head of a small band to surprise him in his tents. But Minuchihr was aware of 
his evil plans, and sprang upon him. And when Tur would have fled Minuchihr 
followed after him and struck a lance into his back. And when he had killed him 
he cut his head from his trunk, and the body did he give unto the wild beasts, 
but the head he sent to Feridoun. And he wrote to him and sent him greeting, and 
told him all that was come about, and how he should neither rest nor tarry until 
the death of Irij be avenged.   
<p>Now Silim, when he learned the fate of his brother, was sore afraid, and cast 
about him for an ally. And there came unto him Kakoui, of the seed of Zohak. But 
Minuchihr wrestled with him for a morning's space and overcame him also, though 
the Dev was strong and powerful in fight. Then Silim was cast down yet more, 
and he sought to hide him by the sea-shore. But Minuchihr cut off his path and 
overtook him, and with his own hand he slew him, and cut his head from his 
trunk. And he raised the head upon his lance. And when the army of Silim saw 
this they fled into the hills, and vanished like cattle whom the snow hath 
driven from their pasture. Then they took counsel and chose out a man from among 
their midst, one that was prudent and gentle of speech. And they bade him go 
before the Shah and say-   
<p>"Have mercy upon us, O Shah, for neither hate nor vengeance drove us forth 
against thee, but only this, that we obeyed the wills of our lords. But we 
ourselves are peaceful men, tillers of the earth and keepers of cattle, and we 
pray thee that thou let us return in safety whence we are come. And we 
acknowledge thee our Shah, and we pray thee make thy servants acquainted with 
thy desires."   
<p>When Minuchihr had heard these words he spake and said- "My desire is not 
after these men, neither is my longing after blood but mercy. Let every man lay 
down his arms and go his ways, and let peace be in the land, and joy wait upon 
your feet."   
<p>When the men heard this they praised the Shah, and called down blessings upon 
his head. And they came before him, every man bearing his armour and the weapons 
of battle. And they laid them at his feet, and of weapons there was reared a 
mighty mountain, and the blue steel glistened in the sun. Then Minuchihr 
dismissed them graciously. And when the army was dispersed he sent a messenger 
unto Feridoun bearing the head of Silim and a writing. And when he had ordered 
all things he set out at the head of his warriors unto the city of Feridoun. And 
his grandsire came forth to meet him, and there came with him many elephants 
swathed in gold, and warriors arrayed in rich attire, and a large multitude clad 
in garments of bright hue. And flags waved above them, and trumpets brayed, and 
cymbals clashed, and sounds of rejoicing filled the air. But when Minuchihr saw 
that his grandsire came towards him, he got from his horse and ran to meet him, 
and fell at his feet and craved his blessing. And Feridoun blessed Minuchihr and 
raised him from the dust. And he bade him sit again upon his horse and took his 
hand, and they entered the city in triumph. And when they were come to the 
King's house, Feridoun seated Minuchihr upon a throne of gold. Then he called 
unto him Saum, the son of Neriman, and said-   
<p>"I pray thee bring up this youth and nourish him for the kingdom, and aid him 
with thy might and mind."   
<p>And he took the hand of Minuchihr and put it into that of Saum, and said-   
<p>"Thanks be unto God the merciful, who hath listened unto my voice, and 
granted the desires of His servant. For now shall I go hence, and the world will 
I cumber no more."   
<p>Then when he had given gifts unto his servants he withdrew into solitude, and 
gazed without cease upon the heads of his sons, neither refrained he from 
bewailing their evil fate, and the sorrow they had brought upon him. And daily 
he grew fainter, and at last the light of his life expired, and Feridoun 
vanished from the earth, but his name remained behind him. And Minuchihr mourned 
for his grandsire with weeping and lamentation, and raised above him a stately 
tomb. But when the seven days of mourning were ended, he put upon his head the 
crown of the Kaianides, and girt his loins with a red sash of might. And the 
nation called him Shah, and he was beloved in the land.
