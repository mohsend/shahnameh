<hr>
<p>
In a little time it came about
 that there was born unto Ferangis, in the 
house of Piran, a son of the race of Saiawush. And Piran, when he had seen the 
babe, goodly of mien, who already in his cradle was like unto a king, sware a 
great oath that Afrasiyab should not destroy it. And when he went before the 
King to tell unto him the tidings, he pleaded for him with his lips. Now the 
heart of Afrasiyab had been softened in his sorrow for Saiawush, wherefore he 
shut his ear unto the evil counsellors that bade him destroy the babe which 
should bring vengeance upon Turan. And he said-   
<p>" I repent me of mine evil deed unto Saiawush, and though it be written that 
much evil shall come upon me from this child sprung from the loins of Tur and 
Kai Kobad, I will strive no more to hinder the decree of the stars; let him, 
therefore, be reared unto manhood. Yet I pray that he be brought up among 
shepherds in the mountains far from the haunts of men, and that his birth be 
hidden from him, that he may not learn of his father or of the cruel things I 
did unto Saiawush."   
<p>And Piran consented unto the desires of Afrasiyab, and he rejoiced because he 
had spared the babe. Then he took the infant from its mother and bare it unto 
the mountains of Kalun, and confided the boy unto the shepherds of the flocks. 
And he said-   
<p>"Guard this child even as your souls, so that neither rain nor dust come near 
him."   
<p>Thus it came about that no man knew of the babe, neither did Ferangis know 
whither it was vanished. But oftentimes was Piran sore disturbed in his spirit, 
for he knew that the beginning of strife was yet to come, and that much evil 
must befall Turan from this infant. Yet he forgot not his promise of protection 
given unto Saiawush his friend, whom he had led to put his trust in Afrasiyab. 
So he quieted his spirit from thinking, for he knew that no man can change the 
course of the stars.   
<p>Now when some time was passed the shepherds came out to Piran and told him 
how they could not restrain this boy, whose valour was like to that of a king. 
Then Piran went forth to visit Kai Khosrau, and he was amazed when he looked 
upon him and beheld his beauty and his strength, and he pressed him unto his 
heart with tenderness. Then Kai Khosrau said-   
<p>"O thou that bearest high thy head, art thou not ashamed to press unto thee 
the son of a shepherd? "   
<p>But Piran was inflamed with love for the boy, so he pondered not his words, 
but said-   
<p>"O heir of kings, thou art not the son of a shepherd." Then he told him of 
his birth, and clad him in robes befitting his station, and took him back with 
him unto his house. And henceforward was Kai Khosrau reared in the bosom of 
Piran and of Ferangis his mother. And the days rolled above their heads in 
happiness.   
<p>Then it came about one night that Piran was awakened by a messenger from 
Afrasiyab the King. And the King bade Piran come before him. And when he was 
come unto him, he said-   
<p>"My heart is disquieted because of the child of Saiawush, and I repent me of 
my weakness which kept him alive; for in my dreams I have beheld that he will do 
much evil unto Turan. Wherefore I would now slay him to avert calamity."   
<p>Then Piran, wise in counsel, opened his mouth before Afrasiyab and spake, 
saying-   
<p>"O King, disquiet not thyself because of this boy, for he is devoid of wit; 
and though his face be like unto that of a Peri, his head, which should bear a 
crown, is empty of reason. Commit, therefore, no violence, but suffer that this 
innocent continue to dwell among the flocks."   
<p>Afrasiyab, when he had listened to these words of wile, was comforted; yet he 
said-   
<p>"Send Kai Khosrau before me, that I may behold with mine eyes his 
simplicity."   
<p>And Piran assented to his request, because he ventured not to gainsay it. So 
he returned him unto his house and sought out the boy, and told him how he 
should disguise his wit before the King. Then he led him unto the court mounted 
upon a goodly charger, and all the people shouted when they beheld his beauty 
and his kingly mien. And Afrasiyab too was confounded at his aspect, and he 
gazed with wonder at his limbs of power, and he strove to remember the promise 
that he had given unto Piran that he would not hurt a hair of the head of this 
boy. Then he began to question him that he might search his spirit. And he 
said-   
<p>"Young shepherd, how knowest thou the day from the night? What doest thou 
with thy flocks? How countest thou thy sheep and thy goats?"   
<p>And Kai Khosrau replied- "There is no game, and I have neither cords nor bow 
and arrows."   
<p>Then the King questioned him concerning the milk that was given of the herds. 
And Kai Khosrau said-   
<p>"The tiger-cats are dangerous and have mighty claws." Then Afrasiyab put to 
him yet a third question, and he asked of him-   
<p>"What is the name of thy mother?" And Kai Khosrau answered and said-" "The 
dog ventureth not to bark when a lion threateneth him."   
<p>Then Afrasiyab asked him yet again whether he desired to go forth into the 
land of Iran and be avenged upon his enemies. And Kai Khosrau answered and 
said-   
<p>"When a leopard appeareth, the heart of a brave man is torn with fear."   
<p>And Afrasiyab smiled at these answers and questioned him no further. And he 
said unto Piran-   
<p>"Restore the boy unto his mother, and let him be reared with kindness in the 
city that Saiawush hath builded, for I behold that from him can no harm alight 
upon Turan."   
<p>When Piran heard these words he hastened to remove Kai Khosrau from the 
court, and his heart was glad because of the danger that had passed by. So Kai 
Khosrau was reared in the house of his father, and Ferangis spake unto him of 
Saiawush and of the vengeance that was due. And she instructed him concerning 
the heroes of Iran and their deeds of prowess, as she had learned them from 
Saiawush her lord.   
<p>In the mean season Kai Kaous had learned of the death of Saiawush his son, 
and a mighty wailing went forth throughout the land of Iran, so that even the 
nightingale in the cypress was silent of her song, and the leaves of the 
pomegranate tree in the forest were withered for sorrow. And the heroes that 
stood about the throne of Kai Kaous clad themselves in the garb of woe, and bare 
dust upon their heads in place of helmets. And Rustem, when he learned of it, 
was bowed to the earth with agony, and for seven days he stirred not from the 
ground, neither would he let food or comfort come near him. But on the eighth he 
roused him from the earth, and caused the trumpets of brass to be sounded into 
the air. And he assembled his warriors, and marched with them into Iran, and he 
came before Kai Kaous and demanded audience.   
<p>Now when he was come into the presence-chamber he found the Shah seated upon 
his throne. He was clothed in dust from his head unto his feet, because of his 
grief. But Rustem regarded it not, and straightway reproached him, and said-   
<p>"O King of evil nature, behold the harvest that is sprung from the seed that 
thou didst sow! The love of Sudaveh and her vile intents have torn from off thy 
head the diadem of kings, and Iran hath suffered cruel loss because of thy folly 
and thy suspicions. It is better for a king that he be laid within his shroud 
than that he be given over to the dominion of a woman. Alas for Saiawush! Was 
ever hero like unto him? And henceforward I will know neither rest nor joy until 
his cruel death be avenged."   
<p>When Kai Kaous had listened to the words of his Pehliva, the colour of shame 
mounted into his cheek, but he held his peace, for he knew that the words spoken 
of Rustem were deserved. Then Rustem, when he saw that the King answered him 
not, strode out from his presence. And he went into the house of the women, and 
sought for Sudaveh, who had given over Saiawush unto death. And when he had 
found her, he tore her from off her throne, and he plunged his dagger into her 
heart, and he quitted her not until the life was gone from her. And Kai Kaous, 
when he learned it, trembled and was afraid, for he dared not oppose himself 
unto Rustem. Then Rustem commanded that the army of vengeance be made ready. And 
he said-   
<p>"I will make the earth to tremble before my mace, as it shall tremble on the 
day of judgment."   
<p>And when all was prepared they made them haste to be gone, and the air was 
full of the gleaming of armour, and the rattling of drums was heard on all 
sides.   
<p>Now when Afrasiyab learned that a great army was come forth from Iran to 
avenge the death of Saiawush, he bade Sarkha, the best beloved of his sons, lead 
forth the hosts of Turan against them. But he craved Sarkha have a care that 
Rustem, the son of Zal, put not his life in danger. And Sarkha set forth, 
bearing aloft the black banner of Turan, and he went towards the plains where 
Rustem was encamped. Now when the armies beheld one another, their hearts were 
inflamed, and the battle raged sore, and many were the brave heads laid low on 
that day. And Sarkha fell into the hands of Rustem, and he spared him not, 
because he was the best beloved son of Afrasiyab. So he gave orders that Sarkha 
be slain, even as Saiawush was slain, that the heart of his enemy might be rent 
with anguish.   
<p>And when Afrasiyab learned it he was beside himself with grief. And when he 
had torn his hair and wailed in the dust for his son, he arose to go forth unto 
the army, that he might avenge his death. And he said unto his knights-   
<p>"Henceforth ye must not think of sleep or hunger, neither must ye breathe 
aught but vengeance, for I will never stay my hand until this murder be 
avenged."   
<p>Now when the army that was with Afrasiyab came nigh unto Rustem, Pilsam, that 
was brother to Piran, a warrior valiant and true, challenged Rustem unto single 
combat. Then Piran sought to stay him because of his youth, but Pilsam listened 
not unto his counsel. So Rustem came forth against him, and he was armed with a 
stout lance, and he was wrapped about with his anger. And he fell upon Pilsam 
with fury, and he lifted him from his saddle, and he took him by the girdle and 
flung him, as a thing that is vile, into the midst of the camp of the Turanians. 
Then he shouted with a voice of thunder-   
<p>"I counsel you, wrap ye this man in robes of gold, for my mace hath made him 
blue."   
<p>Now when the Turanians beheld that Pilsam was dead, they wept sore, and their 
courage departed from out of them. And in vain did Afrasiyab pray them to keep 
their hearts. Yet he said within himself-   
<p>"The good fortune that watched over me is asleep." And when they were met in 
battle yet again, and the army of Rustem had beaten down once more that of 
Afrasiyab, the King bethought him of flight. And the hosts of Turan vanished 
like to the wind, but they left behind them much riches and goodly treasure.   
<p>Now while they were flying from the face of Rustem, Afrasiyab said unto 
Piran-   
<p>"Counsel me how I shall act concerning this child of Saiawush."   
<p>And Piran said, "Haste not to put him to death, for he shall in nowise do 
thee hurt. But if thou wilt listen unto my voice, send him far into Khoten, that 
he be hidden from sight, and that the men of Iran learn not of his being."   
<p>And Afrasiyab did as Piran counselled, and a messenger was sent forth to lead 
out the young King and his mother unto the land of Cathay. And Afrasiyab himself 
fled until that he came within the borders of China, and no man knew where he 
was hidden. And the land of Turan was given over to plunder, and the Iranians 
scathed it with fire and sword because of Saiawush, whom Afrasiyab had foully 
slain. And Rustem seated himself in the seat of Afrasiyab, and for the space of 
seven years did he rule over the land. But in the eighth messengers came out to 
him, and said how that Kai Kaous was without a guide in Iran, and how they 
feared lest folly might result from his deeds. So Rustem went forth to stand 
beside his Shah.   
<p>Now when Afrasiyab learned that Rustem was departed out of the land of Turan, 
his fears forsook him, and he gathered together a mighty army, and he fell upon 
his borders, and he regained them unto himself. And he wept when he beheld the 
havoc that was come upon Turan, and he incited his army to be avenged. So they 
fell into Iran, and shattered its host, and they suffered not that repose come 
near unto their foes. And they pursued them with fire and sword, and laid waste 
their fields. And during seven years the heavens withheld their rains, and good 
fortune was turned away from Iran, and the prosperity of the land was quenched. 
And men groaned sore under these misfortunes, neither did Rustem come forth from 
Zaboulistan unto their aid.   
<p>Then it came about one night that Gudarz, who was descended from Kawah the 
smith, dreamed a dream. He beheld a cloud heavy with rain, and on the cloud was 
seated the Serosch the blessed. And the angel of God said unto Gudarz-   
<p>"Open thine ears, if thou wilt deliver thy land from anguish, and from 
Afrasiyab the Turk. There abideth in Turan the son of a noble race, an issue 
sprung from the loins of Saiawush, who is brave, and beareth high his head. And 
he is sprung from Kai Kobad and from Tur, and from him alone can deliverance 
come to Iran. Suffer, therefore, that Gew, thy son, go forth in search of Kai 
Khosrau, and bid him remain in his saddle until he shall have found this boy. 
For such is the will of Ormuzd."   
<p>When Gudarz awoke, he thanked God for his dream, and touched the ground with 
his white beard. And when the sun was risen and had chased away the ravens of 
night, he called before him his son, and he spake to him of his dream. And he 
commanded him that he go forth to do the behests of God.   
<p>And Gew said, "I will obey thine orders while I live." Then Gudarz said, 
"What companions wilt thou take with thee?   
<p>And Gew said, "My cord and my horse will suffice unto me for company, for it 
is best to take none with me into Turan. For behold, if I lead out an host, men 
will ask what I am, and wherefore I come forth; but if I go alone, their doubts 
will slumber."   
<p>Then Gudarz said, "Go, and peace be upon thee." So Gew made ready his steed, 
and when he had bidden farewell unto the old man his father, he set out upon his 
travels. And wherever he met a man walking alone, he questioned him concerning 
Kai Khosrau; and if the man knew not the name, he struck off his head, that none 
might learn his secret or wherefore he was come forth.   
<p>Now Gew wandered thus many days throughout the length of Turan, like to a man 
distraught, and he could learn nought concerning Kai Khosrau, the young king. 
And seven years rolled thus above his head, and he grew lean and sorrowful. And 
for house he had nought save only his saddle, and for nourishment and clothing 
the flesh and skin of the wild ass, and in place of wine he had only bad water. 
And he began to be downcast in his spirit, and afraid lest the dream dreamed of 
his father had been sent unto him by a Dev. Now it came about one day that 
while he pondered thus he entered a forest, and when he was come into its midst, 
he beheld therein a fountain, and a young man, slim as a cypress, seated beside 
it. And the youth held in his hand a wine-cup, and on his head was a crown of 
flowers, and his mien was such that the soul of Gew rejoiced thereat, and the 
door of his cares was loosened. And he said within himself-   
<p>"If this be not the King, then must I abandon my search, for I think to 
behold in him the face of Saiawush."   
<p>Then he went nigh unto him. Now when Kai Khosrau beheld the warrior, he 
smiled and said-   
<p>"O Gew, thou art welcome unto my sight, since thou art come hither at the 
behest of God. Tell unto me now, I pray thee, tidings of Tus and Gudarz, of 
Rustem, and of Kai Kaous the King. Are they happy? Do they know of Kai 
Khosrau?"   
<p>When Gew heard this speech, he was confounded; and when he had returned 
thanks unto God, he opened his mouth and spake, saying-   
<p>"O young King, who bearest high thy head, reveal unto me who hath told thee 
of Gudarz and of Tus, of Rustem and of Kai Kaous, and how knowest thou my name 
and aspect."   
<p>Then Kai Khosrau said, "My mother hath told me of the things which she 
learned of my father. For I am son unto Saiawush, and before he entered upon 
death he foretold unto Ferangis how Gew would come forth from Iran to lead me 
unto the throne."   
<p>Then Gew said, "Prove unto me thy words. Suffer that mine eyes behold the 
mark of the Kaianides which thou bearest about thy body."   
<p>Then Kai Khosrau uncovered his arm, and when Gew looked upon the mark that 
was borne of all the royal house since the time of Kai Kobad, he fell down upon 
the ground and did homage before this youth. But Kai Khosrau raised him from the 
dust and embraced him, and questioned him concerning his journey and the 
hardships he had passed through. Then Gew mounted the young King upon his 
charger, and he walked before him bearing an Indian sword unsheathed in his 
hand. And they journeyed until they came to the city that Saiawush had 
builded.   
<p>Now when Ferangis saw them she received them joyfully, for her quick spirit 
divined what was come to pass. But she counselled them to tarry not in 
whatsoever they would do. For she said-   
<p>"When Afrasiyab shall learn of this he will neither eat nor sleep, he will 
send out an army against us. Let us flee, therefore, before he cometh. And 
listen now unto the words that I shall speak. Go forth unto the mountain that is 
raised unto the clouds, and take with thee a saddle and a bridle. And when thou 
shalt have scaled its crest thou wilt behold a meadow green as a paradise, and 
browsing upon it the flocks of Saiawush. And in their midst will be Behzah the 
steed of battle. Go nigh unto him, my son, and embrace him, and whisper thy name 
into his ear; and when he shall have heard it he will suffer thee to mount him, 
and seated upon him thou shalt escape from the slayer of thy father."   
<p>Then Gew and Kai Khosrau went out and did as Ferangis told unto them; and 
they found the steed, and when Behzah beheld the saddle of Saiawush and the 
leopard-skin he had worn, he sighed, and his eyes were filled with tears. Then 
he suffered Kai Khosrau to mount him, and they turned back unto Ferangis. And 
she chose forth the armour of Saiawush from among her treasures and gave it to 
her son, and she clad herself in mail of Roum like unto a warrior, and she 
sprang upon a horse of battle, and when all was done they set forth to fly from 
the land of Afrasiyab.   
<p>Now one brought tidings unto Piran of these things, and he was dismayed 
thereat, for he said-   
<p>"Now will be accomplished the fears of Afrasiyab, and mine honour will be 
tarnished in his eyes."   
<p>So he bade Kelbad and three hundred valiant knights pursue Kai Khosrau and 
bind him and bring him back in chains.   
<p>Now Ferangis and her son slept for weariness by the roadside, but Gew held 
guard over them. And when he beheld Kelbad and the men that were with him, he 
knew that they were come in pursuit; yet he awakened not Kai Khosrau, but of his 
strength alone put them to flight. But when they were gone he roused the 
sleepers, and he urged haste upon them.   
<p>But Piran, when he beheld that Kelbad returned unto him defeated at the hand 
of one man, was loath to credit it, and he was angered against him, and said 
that he would go forth himself. So Piran made him ready, and a thousand brave 
warriors went with him. For Piran was afraid of the anger of Afrasiyab, and that 
he would put this flight unto his account, and not unto that of the rotation of 
the stars. Now when he was come unto the fugitives Gew and the young King 
slumbered, but Ferangis was keeping watch. And when she beheld the army she woke 
them and bade them prepare for combat; but Gew suffered not that Kai Khosrau 
should go forth, for he said-   
<p>"If I fall, what mattereth that? my father hath seventy and eight sons like 
unto me; but thou art alone, and if thy head shall fall, what other is worthy of 
the crown?"   
<p>And Kai Khosrau did as Gew desired. Then Gew gave combat unto Piran, and by 
his courage he overcame the army; and he caught the old man Piran in the meshes 
of his cord. Then he brought him bound before Ferangis and Kai Khosrau her 
son.   
<p>Now Piran, when he beheld Kai Khosrau, demanded not mercy at his hands, but 
invoked the blessings of Heaven upon his head, and he mourned the fate of 
Saiawush. And he said-   
<p>"O King, had thy slave been nigh unto Afrasiyab, surely the head of thy 
father would not have fallen at his hands. And it was I who preserved thee and 
Ferangis thy mother, yet now is it given unto me to fall under thy hands."   
<p>When Kai Khosrau heard these words his heart went out unto Piran, and when he 
looked towards his mother he saw that her eyes were filled with tears. Then she 
opened her mouth and poured forth curses upon Afrasiyab her father, and she 
wailed the fate of Saiawush, and she pleaded for the life of this good old man. 
For she said-   
<p>"His tenderness hath been an asylum unto our sorrow, and now is it given unto 
us to remember the benefits we have received at his hands."   
<p>But Gew, when he heard it, said- "O Queen, I pray thee speak not thus, for I 
have sworn a great oath that I would stain the earth with the blood of Piran, 
and how can I depart from my vow?"   
<p>Then Kai Khosrau said, "O hero like unto a lion, thou shalt not break the 
oath that thou hast made before God. Satisfy thy heart and accomplish thy vow. 
Pierce with thy dagger the ear of Piran, and let his blood fall on the earth, 
that thy vengeance and my clemency may both be satisfied."   
<p>Then Gew did as Kai Khosrau bade, and when he had crimsoned the earth with 
the blood of Piran, they mounted him upon a charger fleet of foot and bound him 
thereon, and caused him to swear unto them that none other but Gulshehr his wife 
should release him from these bonds. And Piran sware it and went forth, and his 
mouth poured blessings upon Kai Khosrau.   
<p>Now while these things were passing Afrasiyab grew impatient, and set forth 
himself at the head of a great army that he might learn tidings of Kai Khosrau. 
And when he heard that the armies had been beaten at the hand of one man, his 
cheeks grew pale with fear; but when he met Piran his Pehliva tied upon his 
charger, his anger knew no bounds, so that he cried aloud, and commanded Piran 
that he depart from out his presence. Then he sware that he would himself 
destroy this Gew, and lay low the head of Kai Khosrau and of his mother. And he 
made great haste after them, and he urged upon his men that they must find Kai 
Khosrau before he should have crossed the Jihun and have entered upon the land 
of Iran; yet before ever he was come nigh to them, the three were come unto its 
banks.   
<p>Now, a boat was lying ready, and a boatman slumbered beside it; and Gew 
roused him, and said that he should bear them across the river. But the man was 
greedy of gain, and beheld that Gew was in haste. So he said-   
<p>"Why should I carry thee across? Yet, if thou desire it, I demand that thou 
give unto me one of four things: thy coat of mail, or thy black horse, yon 
woman, or the crown of gold worn by this young man."   
<p>Then Gew was angry, and said- "Thou speakest like a fool; thou knowest not 
what thou dost ask."   
<p>Then he turned unto Kai Khosrau, and said- "If thou be Kai Khosrau indeed, 
thou wilt not fear to enter this river and cross it, even as it was crossed by 
Feridoun thy sire."   
<p>Now the river was swollen with the rains, but the young King regarded it not. 
He entered upon its surge with Behzah his steed, and the horse of his father 
bare him across the boiling waters. And Ferangis followed after him and Gew the 
bold. And when Kai Khosrau was come unto the other side, he dismounted and knelt 
and kissed the ground of Iran, and gave thanks unto God the mighty.   
<p>Yet scarce were they come to the other side than Afrasiyab came up with his 
army. And Afrasiyab demanded of the boatman wherefore he had borne them across, 
and when the man told him how it was come to pass, the King was bowed down with 
anguish, for he knew now that that which was written would be accomplished. So 
he returned him right sorrowful unto his house.   
<p>Now when Kai Khosrau came nigh unto the courts of the Shah, Gew sent a 
writing unto Kai Kaous and told him all that was come to pass. And Kai Kaous 
sent forth riders to lead before him his son; and the city was decked to give 
him welcome, and all the nobles received him joyfully, and Kai Kaous was glad at 
the sight of him, and all men regarded Kai Khosrau as the heir, and only Tus was 
sorrowful at that which was come to pass. But Tus was angered, and said that he 
would pay homage only unto Friburz, and to none other. And he came before Kai 
Kaous and said-   
<p>"Friburz is thy son also, why therefore wilt thou give the crown unto one who 
is sprung from the race of Afrasiyab?   
<p>Then Gew said, "It is fitting that the son of Saiawush should succeed unto 
the throne."   
<p>But Tus listened not, and refused allegiance unto Kai Khosrau, and there was 
strife among the nobles of Iran.   
<p>Then one came before Kai Kaous and begged of him that he would declare 
himself, for he said-   
<p>"If we are divided among ourselves we shall fall a prey into the hands of 
Afrasiyab. Let the Shah, therefore, bind up this quarrel."   
<p>Then Kai Kaous said, "Ye ask of me that which is hard, for both my sons are 
dear unto me, and how should I choose between them? Yet I will bethink me of a 
means to quiet this dissension. Let Kai Khosrau and Friburz go forth unto 
Bahman, the fortress that is upon my borders which no man hath conquered, for it 
is an abode of Devs, and fire issueth thence continually. And let them take 
with them an army, and I will bestow my crown and my treasures upon him at whose 
hands the castle shall be subdued."   
<p>So Friburz and Kai Khosrau set forth, and Kai Khosrau suffered that his elder 
take the lead. But in vain did Friburz strive against the Devs that were hidden 
behind the walls, and when seven days had passed he returned discomfited from 
his emprise. Then Kai Khosrau set forth, and he wrote a letter, amber-perfumed, 
and in it he desired the evil Devs that they give place unto him in the name of 
Ormuzd. And he affixed the letter unto the point of his lance, and when he was 
come nigh unto the burning fort he flung it beyond the walls. Then a great noise 
rent the air like thunder, and the world became darkened, and when the light 
returned unto the sky the castle was vanished from off the face of the 
earth.   
<p>Now when Kai Kaous heard it, he knew that the son of Saiawush was learned in 
the arts of magic, as was fitting unto a king; and he beheld also that he was 
wise and brave. And because that he was weary he surrendered the throne unto 
him, and Kai Khosrau wore the crown of the Kaianides in his stead.
