<hr>
<p>
Dire was the wailing among the
 army of Iran at their sore defeat, and they 
turned them back discomfited. And they came before the Shah, their hearts torn 
with anguish. And their hands were crossed upon their breasts, and they were 
humble as slaves. And Kai Khosrau was angry when he beheld them, and he 
remembered Firoud, and he railed against Tus, from whom was sprung this evil. 
And he said-   
<p>"Cursed be he and his elephants and his cymbals." And the Shah withdrew from 
his courts, and he withheld his countenance from the land. So the nobles went 
out unto Rustem, and entreated of him that he would intercede for them with the 
Shah. And Rustem did as they desired, and he pleaded for the army and its 
leaders, and he spake good even of Tus. And Kai Khosrau inclined his ear unto 
his Pehliva, and he let the light of his countenance shine again upon his army, 
and he confided unto Tus once more the standard of Kawah, but he made Gew march 
beside him and restrain his haste.   
<p>So they set forth again unto Turan, and Afrasiyab, when he learned of their 
approach, made ready his army also. And there were joined unto him the hosts of 
the Khakan of China, and of the Kamous of Kushan, men mighty in the battlefield. 
And from Ind and all the highlands of Asia there came forth troops unto the aid 
of Afrasiyab, King of Turan. And he rejoiced thereat, for he was assured that if 
Rustem came not forth to aid them, the men of Iran could not stand against his 
host.   
<p>Now when the two armies met, many and fierce were the combats waged between 
them, and blows were given and received, and swords flashed and showers of 
arrows descended on all sides. And the blood of brave men was shed like unto the 
shedding of rain from a black cloud. And day by day were the Iranians weakened, 
for they were smitten with great slaughter, and the number of their dead was 
past the counting. But Afrasiyab rejoiced in his victory, and his heart shouted 
within him when he learned after many days that the Iranians were drawn back 
into the mountains. But Kai Khosrau, when he learned it, was afflicted, and wept 
sore. Then he sent greeting unto Rustem, his Pehliva, and he craved of him that 
he would come forth to aid the army, for in him alone could he put his trust. 
And Rustem said-   
<p>"O Shah, since the day that mine arm could wield a mace, I have ever fought 
the battles of Iran, and it would seem that rest may never come nigh unto me. 
Yet since I am thy slave, it behoveth me to obey. I am ready to do thy 
desires."   
<p>So he made ready an host to go unto the succour of Iran. And while he did so 
the army was defeated yet again, and all heart went from the Iranians, and they 
would have given them over unto their foes. But while they pondered it, there 
came tidings unto Gudarz that Rustem was drawing nigh. Yet they feared to give 
way unto belief. But Piran when he heard it was sore discomfited, for he 
remembered of old the might of Rustem, and he knew that none could stand before 
it. But the Khakan and the Kamous scoffed at his fears, and they made loud 
boastings that Rustem should fall by their hands.   
<p>Now when some days had passed in this disquietude, it came about one night 
that, when the moon showed her face above the mountains, like unto a victorious 
king seated upon a throne of turquoise, a watchman of Iran set up a great cry. 
And he said-   
<p>"The plain is filled with dust, and the night resoundeth with noise. And I 
behold a mighty army drawing nigh, and they bear torches, and in their midst 
rideth Rustem the mighty."   
<p>When the men of Iran heard this, they set up a great shout, and their hearts 
seemed to come back into their bodies, and their courage, that had been as dead, 
returned. And glad was the greeting that they gave unto Rustem the Pehliva. And 
Rustem mustered them and put them into battle order, and when the sun had 
wearied of the black veil, and had torn the night asunder, and reappeared unto 
the world, the men of Iran called upon the host of Turan to come forth in 
combat. And they defied them unto battle, and they fought with new valour, and 
they made great havoc in their ranks. And when the evening was come, the day 
belonged unto Iran.   
<p>Then Piran called before him Human the brave, and said unto him-   
<p>"The nobles of Iran have found again their courage, since an army is come to 
their aid. Yet I would know if Rustem be their leader, for him alone do I 
fear."   
<p>And when he learned it his spirit was troubled. But the Kamous mocked him, 
and sware a great oath that, ere the sun should be set once more, he would have 
broken the might of Rustem. For he said-   
<p>"There is none, not even a mad elephant, that is mine equal in the 
fight."   
<p>So when the day was come, the Kamous challenged Rustem unto single combat. 
And Rustem strode forth from the camp, and the Kamous met him upon the plain. 
Then they struggled sore, and wrestled one with another, but in the end Rustem 
caught the Kamous in the meshes of his cord. And he showed him unto the army, 
and he asked of them, saying-   
<p>"What death desire ye that the Kamous should die, for his hour is come?"   
<p>Then he threw him among the nobles, and they made an end of him with their 
spears, and they flung his body to the vultures.   
<p>Now when the Khakan heard of the death of the Kamous, he sware that he would 
avenge him, and he sent forth a messenger to defy Rustem. But Rustem said unto 
the messenger-   
<p>"I seek no quarrel with the Khakan, and in all your army I desire only to 
look upon the face of Piran. And I beg of him that he will come forth to greet 
me, for my heart burneth towards him, because he was afflicted for the death of 
Saiawush, my foster-son, and because of the good he did unto Kai Khosrau and 
unto his mother."   
<p>So the messenger bare these words unto Piran. And Piran, when he had taken 
counsel, listened unto the desires of Rustem, and came into his tents. And he 
said-   
<p>"I am Piran, leader of the hosts of Turan. Speak unto me thy name."   
<p>And Rustem said, "I am Rustem of Zaboulistan, and I am armed with a mace and 
a sword of Cabul."   
<p>Then he gave him greeting from Kai Khosrau, and he lauded him for the good 
deeds that he had done unto Saiawush and to his son, and he entreated him that 
he would turn away from Afrasiyab, and go with him unto Kai Khosrau. And he 
said-   
<p>"Iran desireth not to destroy the innocent. Therefore deliver over unto me 
the men upon whose head resteth the blood of Saiawush, and we will withdraw our 
hosts, and there shall be peace in the land."   
<p>Then Piran said, "That which thou askest, verily it can never be, for the 
slayers of Saiawush are near kinsfolk unto Afrasiyab. And because he hath named 
me the leader of his hosts, it may not be that I abandon them. But I say unto 
thee, that it would be sweeter unto me to die than to conduct this warfare, and 
that my heart is torn because I must lift up the sword of enmity against Kai 
Khosrau, my son."   
<p>And Rustem saw that the words that Piran spake were true, and he sorrowed for 
him. And when they parted it was in friendship, although they knew that battle 
must rage between them. Then they drew up their armies, and for forty days there 
was waged a battle, mighty and terrible. And great ravages were committed, and 
Rustem did deeds of valour, and the strong and the weak were alike impotent 
before him. And the plains were strewn with the bodies of the slain, until that 
an ant could not have found a road to pass between them, and the blood of the 
wounded streamed on all sides, and heads without bodies and bodies without heads 
covered the ground. For neither the claw of the leopard nor the trunk of the 
elephant, neither the high mountains nor the waters of the earth, could prevail 
against Rustem when he fought at the head of his hosts. And he slew the 
mightiest among the Turanians, and only Piran was he mindful to spare. And the 
Khakan of China was enmeshed in his cord, and he sent him bound unto Kai Khosrau 
with news of the victory. And when the Turanians fled before his face, he 
followed after them and pursued them unto the mountains.   
<p>Then Piran made haste to come before Afrasiyab, and he spake to him and 
said-   
<p>"The land is changed into a sea of blood, for Rustem is come forth, and who 
can stand against him? And he followeth after me close. Wherefore I counsel 
thee, flee; for how canst thou stand alone against him? Alas for the woe that 
thou hast brought upon Turan! Thou hast wounded our hearts with the iron of the 
arrow wherewith thou didst slay Saiawush the noble."   
<p>Then he urged upon him that he tarry not. So Afrasiyab fled from before the 
face of Rustem and hid himself in the mountains. And when Rustem came into his 
courts and found that the King was fled, he seized upon much booty and divided 
it among his men, and he feasted them many days in the house of Afrasiyab, and 
he suffered them to enjoy repose. Then he destroyed with fire the palace, and 
when he had done so he turned him to go back unto Kai Khosrau.   
<p>Now when he was come within the city of the Shah, glad cries rang through all 
the air, and the sound of drums filled the land of Iran, and there was joy 
throughout its breadth because the destroyer of Turan was returned. And the 
heart of Kai Khosrau rejoiced like a paradise, and he came out to meet his 
Pehliva mounted upon an elephant gaily caparisoned, and music and singers went 
before him. And he invited him to a great feast, and he poured rich gifts upon 
him. And for a month Rustem abode in the presence of his Shah, making merry with 
wine. And the singers chanted of his great deeds, and the sounds of flutes and 
stringed instruments went with their words. But when that time was over Rustem 
asked of Kai Khosrau that he would suffer him to return unto Zal his father, for 
his heart yearned to look upon his face. And Kai Khosrau suffered it.   
<p>Now Rustem was not returned long unto Zaboulistan before there came into the 
courts of the Shah a shepherd who desired to speak with Kai Khosrau. And the 
Shah granted his request, and the man opened his mouth before him, and he 
said-   
<p>"A wild ass is broken in among my horses, and he doeth great mischief, for 
his breath is like unto a lion. Send forth, therefore, I entreat of thee, O King 
of Kings, a warrior of thine host that he may slay him."   
<p>Now Kai Khosrau, when he had listened, knew that this was not a wild ass but 
the Dev Akwan, who had taken this disguise upon him. So he cast about whom he 
should send forth to meet him, and he knew there was none other but Rustem, the 
son of Zal, to whom he could turn in this strait. So he sent a messenger swift 
as a cloud before a storm to summon him forth yet again. And Rustem obeyed the 
voice of his Shah, and he set forth in search of the Dev, and he was mounted 
upon Rakush his steed. And in his hand was a mighty mace, and round his wrist 
was rolled a cord of length. And he went in search of the wild ass, and when he 
had found him he threw his cord about him. But the ass vanished under his hands. 
Then Rustem knew that it was a Dev, and that he fought against the arts of 
magic. Yet was he not dismayed. And after a while the ass came forth again, and 
Rustem threw his cord once more about him. And yet again the Dev vanished under 
his hand. And thus did the Dev three days and three nights without ceasing, so 
that weariness came upon Rustem and he was heavy with slumber. So he sought out 
a spot of safety and he laid him down to rest, and he bade Rakush browse beside 
him.   
<p>Now when the Dev saw that Rustem was sleeping, he drew nigh and loosened the 
earth whereon he lay, and lifted it and placed it upon his head, that he might 
cast it away and destroy Rustem. But as he carried him Rustem awoke, and when he 
saw what was come to pass he feared that his hour was come. And the Dev, when 
he beheld that Rustem was awakened, spake, and said unto him-   
<p>"O hero, which death dost thou covet? Shall I fling thee down upon the 
mountain or cast thee into the sea?"   
<p>Now Rustem knew that the Dev questioned him in wile, and he bethought him 
that he would of a surety do that which Rustem desired not, so he said-   
<p>"I have heard it said that it is not given to those that perish in the waters 
to look upon the face of the Serosch or to find rest in the life that is 
beyond."   
<p>Then the Dev said, "I desire that thou know not repose."   
<p>And he flung him into the sea at a spot where hungry crocodiles would devour 
him.   
<p>Now Rustem, when he felt the water beneath him, forthwith drew out his sword 
and combated the crocodiles with his right hand, and with his left he swam 
towards the shore. And long did he struggle and sore, but when the night was 
fallen he put his foot upon the dry land. Then, when he had given thanks unto 
God and rested him, he returned unto the spot where he had found the Dev. And 
he sought after Rakush his steed, and his eye beheld him not. Then fear filled 
his spirit, and he roamed around to seek him. And he found him at last among the 
horses of Afrasiyab, that grazed in a spot hard by, for the keepers had ensnared 
him. But when Rakush heard the voice of Rustem he neighed aloud, and brake from 
the keepers and ran towards his master. And Rustem put the saddle upon him and 
mounted him. Then he slew the keepers and took their herds unto himself.   
<p>Now while he was so doing Afrasiyab came forth from his hiding-place, for his 
heart yearned to look upon his horses. And when he beheld Rustem in their midst 
he was dismayed, and knew not whither he should turn, for he deemed that the 
Pehliva had discovered his hiding-place and was come forth against him. So he 
offered battle unto him with the men that were with him. And Rustem accepted the 
challenge, although he was alone; and he fought with might and overcame the men, 
and slew sixty of them with his sword and forty with his mace. And Afrasiyab 
fled once more from before him.   
<p>Now when it was done the Dev came forth again, for he thought he could quell 
Rustem now that he was weary. But Rustem sprang on him and crushed him, and he 
was slain at his hands. Then the Pehliva returned unto Kai Khosrau. And when the 
Shah had learned of all his deeds, and beheld the booty that he had brought 
back, his mouth could not cease from praising the prowess of Rustem, and he 
would have kept his Pehliva beside him for ever. But Rustem said-   
<p>"Suffer thy servant to go forth. For I would make ready an host, since it 
behoveth us not to cease from the vengeance that is due unto Saiawush, for his 
murderers yet cumber the ground."   
<p>Wherefore Rustem departed yet again from out the courts of the Shah.
