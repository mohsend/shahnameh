Seistan, which is to the south of Iran, was ruled by Saum,
the Pehliva, girt with might and glory, and, but for the grief that he was childless, his days 
were happy. Then it came to pass that a son was born unto him, beautiful of face 
and limb, who had neither fault nor blemish save that his hair was like unto 
that of an aged man. Now the women were afraid to tell Saum, lest he be wroth 
when he should learn that his child was thus set apart from his fellow-men. So 
the infant had gazed upon the light eight days ere he knew thereof. Then a 
woman, brave above the rest, ventured into his presence. She bowed herself unto 
the dust and craved of Saum the boon of speech. And he suffered her, and she 
spake, saying-   
<p>"May the Lord keep and guard thee. May thine enemies be utterly destroyed. 
May the days of Saum the hero be happy. For the Almighty hath accomplished his 
desire. He hath given to him an heir, a son is born unto the mighty warrior 
behind the curtains of his house, a moon-faced boy, beautiful of face and limb, 
in whom there is neither fault nor blemish, save that his hair is like unto that 
of an aged man. I beseech thee, O my master, bethink thee that this gift is from 
God, nor give place in thine heart to ingratitude."   
<p>When Saum had listened to her words he arose and went unto the house of the 
women. And he beheld the babe that was beautiful of face and limb, but whose 
head was like unto that of an aged man. Then Saum, fearing the jeers of his 
enemies, quitted the paths of wisdom. He lifted his head unto heaven and 
murmured against the Lord of Destiny, and cried, saying-   
<p>"O thou eternally just and good, O source of happiness, incline thine ear 
unto me and listen to my voice. If I have sinned, if I have strayed in the paths 
of Ahriman, behold my repentance and pardon me. My soul is ashamed, my heart is 
angered for reason of this child, for will not the nobles say this boy presageth 
evil? They will hold me up to shame, and what can I reply to their questions? It 
behoveth me to remove this stain, that the land of Iran be not accursed."   
<p>Thus spake Saum in his anger, railing against fate, and he commanded his 
servants to take the child and cast it forth out of the land.   
<p>Now there standeth far from the haunts of men the Mount Alberz, whose head 
toucheth the stars, and never had mortal foot been planted upon its crest. And 
upon it had the Simurgh, the bird of marvel, builded her nest. Of ebony and of 
sandal-wood did she build it, and twined it with aloes, so that it was like unto 
a king's house, and the evil sway of Saturn could not reach thereto. And at the 
foot of this mount was laid the child of Saum. Then the Simurgh, when she spied 
the infant lying upon the ground, bereft of clothes and wherewithal to nourish 
it, sucking its fingers for very hunger, darted to earth and raised him in her 
talons. And she bare him unto her nest, that her young might devour him. But 
when she had brought him her heart was stirred within her for compassion. 
Therefore she bade her young ones spare the babe and treat him like to a 
brother. Then she chose out tender flesh to feed her guest, and tended the 
infant forsaken of his sire. And thus did the Simurgh, nor ever wearied till 
that moons and years had rolled above their heads, and the babe was grown to be 
a youth full of strength and beauty. And his renown filled the land, for neither 
good nor evil can be hidden for ever. And his fame spread even unto the ears of 
Saum, the son of Neriman.   
<p>Then it came to pass that Saum dreamed a dream, wherein he beheld a man 
riding towards him mounted upon an Arab steed. And the man gave him tidings of 
his son, and taunted him, saying-   
<p>"O thou who hast offended against every duty, who disownest thy son because 
that his hair is white, though thine own resembleth the silver poplar, and to 
whom a bird seemeth fit nurse for thine offspring, wilt thou abjure all kinship 
with him for ever?"   
<p>Now when Saum awoke he remembered his dream, and fear came upon him for his 
sin. And he called unto him his Mubids, and questioned them concerning the 
stripling of the Mount Alberz, and whether this could be indeed his son, for 
surely frosts and heat must long since have destroyed him. Then the Mubids 
answered and said-   
<p>"Not so, thou most ungrateful unto God, thou more cruel than the lion, the 
tiger, and the crocodile, for even savage beasts tend their young, whilst thou 
didst reject thine own, because thou heldest the white hair given unto him by 
his Creator for a reproach in the sight of men. O faint of heart, arise and seek 
thy child, for surely one whom God hath blessed can never perish. And turn thou 
unto him and pray that he forgive thee."   
<p>When Saum had heard these words he was contrite, and called about him his 
army and set forth unto the mountains. And when they were come unto the mount 
that is raised up to the Pleiades, Saum beheld the Simurgh and the nest, and a 
stripling that was like unto himself walking around it. And his desire to get 
unto him was great, but he strove in vain to scale the crest. Then Saum called 
upon God in his humility. And God heard him, and put it into the heart of the 
Simurgh to look down and behold the warrior and the army that was with him. And 
when she had seen Saum she knew wherefore the chief was come, and she spake and 
said-   
<p>"O thou who hast shared this nest, I have reared thee and been to thee a 
mother, for thy father cast thee out; the hour is come to part us, and I must 
give thee again unto thy people. For thy father is Saum the hero, the Pehliva of 
the world, greatest among the great, and he is come hither to seek his son, and 
splendour awaiteth thee beside him."   
<p>When the youth had heard her words his eyes were filled with tears and his 
heart with sorrow, for he had never gazed upon men, though he had learned their 
speech. And he said-   
<p>"Art thou then weary of me, or am I no longer fit to be thy house-fellow? 
See, thy nest is unto me a throne, thy sheltering wings a parent. To thee I owe 
all that I am, for thou wast my friend in need."   
<p>And the Simurgh answered him saying, "I do not send thee away for enmity, O 
my son; nay, I would keep thee beside me for ever, but another destiny is better 
for thee. When thou shalt have seen the throne and its pomp my nest will sink in 
thine esteem. Go forth, therefore, my son, and try thy fortune in the world. But 
that thou mayst remember thy nurse who shielded thee, and reared thee amid her 
little ones, that thou mayst remain under the shadow of her wings, bear with 
thee this feather from her breast. And in the day of thy need cast it into the 
fire, and I will come like unto a cloud and deliver thee from danger."   
<p>Thus she spake, and raised him in her talons and bore him to the spot where 
Saum was bowed to the dust in penitence. Now when Saum beheld his son, whose 
body was like unto an elephant's for strength and beauty, he bent low before the 
Simurgh and covered her with benison. And he cried out and said-   
<p>"O Shah of birds, O bird of God, who confoundest the wicked, mayst thou be 
great for ever."   
<p>But while he yet spake the Simurgh flew upwards, and the gaze of Saum was 
fixed upon his son. And as he looked he saw that he was worthy of the throne, 
and that there was neither fault nor blemish in him, save only his silvery 
locks. Then his heart rejoiced within him, and he blessed him, and entreated his 
forgiveness. And he said-   
<p>"O my son, open thine heart unto the meanest of God's servants, and I swear 
unto thee, in the presence of Him that made us, that never again will I harden 
my heart towards thee, and that I will grant unto thee all thy desires."   
<p>Then he clothed him in rich robes and named him Zal, which being interpreted 
meaneth the aged. And he showed him unto the army. And when they had looked on 
the youth they saw that he was goodly of visage and of limb, and they shouted 
for very joy. Then the host made them ready to return unto Seistan. And the 
kettle-drummers rode at their head, mounted upon mighty elephants whose feet 
raised a cloud of dust that rose unto the sky. And the tabors were beat, and the 
trumpets brayed, and the cymbals clashed, and sounds of rejoicing filled the 
land because that Saum had found his son, and that Zal was a hero among men.   
<p>Now the news spread even unto Minuchihr that Saum was returning from the 
mountains with great pomp and joy. And when he had heard it he bade Nuder go 
forth to meet the Pehliva and bid him bring Zal unto the court. And when Saum 
heard the desires of his master he obeyed and came within his gates. Then he 
beheld the Shah seated upon the throne of the Kaianides, bearing his crown upon 
his head, and on his right hand sat Karun the Pehliva, and he bade Saum be 
seated on his left. And the Shah commanded Saum that he should speak. Then Saum 
unbosomed himself before the Shah and spake concerning his son, neither did he 
hide his evil deed. And Minuchihr commanded that Zal be brought before him. So 
the chamberlains brought him into the presence of the King, and he was clad in 
robes of splendour, and the King was amazed at his aspect. And he turned and 
said unto Saum-   
<p>"O Pehliva of the world, the Shah enjoineth you have a care of this noble 
youth, and guard him for the land of Iran. And teach him forthwith the arts of 
war, and the pleasures and customs of the banquet, for how should one that hath 
been reared in a nest be familiar with our ways?   
<p>Then the Shah bade the Mubids cast Zal's horoscope, and they read that he 
would be a brave and prudent knight. Now when he had heard this the Pehliva was 
relieved of all his fears, and the Shah rejoiced and covered Saum with gifts. 
Arab horses did he give unto him with golden saddles, Indian swords in scabbards 
of gold, brocades of Roum, skins of beasts, and carpets of Ind, and the rubies 
and pearls were past the numbering. And slaves poured musk and amber before him. 
And Minuchihr also granted to Saum a throne, and a crown and a girdle of gold, 
and he named him ruler of all the lands that stretch from the Sea of China to 
that of Sind, from Zaboulistan to the Caspian. Then he bade that the Pehliva's 
horse be led forth, and sent him away from his presence. And Saum called down 
blessings upon the Shah, and turned his face towards home. And his train 
followed after him, and the sound of music went before them.   
<p>Then when the tidings came to Seistan that the great hero was drawing nigh, 
the city decked itself in festive garbs, and every man called down the blessings 
of Heaven upon Zal, the son of Saum, and poured gifts at his feet. And there was 
joy in all the land for that Saum had taken back his son.   
<p>Now Saum forthwith called about him his Mubids, and bade them instruct the 
youth in all the virtues of a king.   
<p>And daily Zal increased in wisdom and strength, and his fame filled the land. 
And when Saum went forth to fight the battles of the Shah, he left the kingdom 
under his hands, and Zal administered it with judgment and virtue.
