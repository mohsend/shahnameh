Now ere the son of Zal was born, Rudabeh was sore afflicted, and neither by 
day nor night could she find rest. Then Zal in his trouble bethought him of the 
Simurgh, his nurse, and how she had given unto him a feather that he might use 
it in the hour of his need. And he cast the feather into the fire as she had 
commanded, and straightway a sound of rushing wings filled the air, and the sky 
was darkened and the bird of God stood before Zal. And she said unto him-   
<p>"O my son, wherefore art thou troubled, and why are the eyes of this lion wet 
with tears?"   
<p>Then he told her of his sorrow, and she bade him be of good cheer, "For 
verily thy nurse who shielded thee, and reared thee when thy father cast thee 
out, is come yet again to succour thee."   
<p>And she told him how he should act, and when she had done speaking she turned 
her once more towards her nest. But Zal did as she had commanded, and there was 
born to him a son comely of limb. And when Rudabeh beheld the babe, she smiled 
and said-   
<p>"Verily he shall be called Rustem (which, being interpreted, meaneth 
delivered), for I am delivered of my pains."   
<p>And all the land was glad that a son was come unto Zal the hero, and the 
sounds of feasting and joy were heard throughout its breadth.   
<p>Then fleet messengers brought the sweet tidings unto Saum. And they bare with 
them an image of Rustem sewn of silk, whereon were traced the features of this 
lion's whelp, and a club was put into its hands, and it was mounted upon a 
dromedary. Now when Saum beheld the image his heart leaped up within him. He 
poured mountains of gold before the messengers, and gave thanks unto Ormuzd that 
he had suffered his eyes to look upon this child.   
<p>And when eight summers had rolled above their heads, Saum learned that Rustem 
was mighty of stature and fair of mien, and his heart yearned towards him. He 
therefore made ready a mighty host and passed unto Zaboulistan, that he might 
look upon his son. And Rustem rode forth to meet his sire, mounted upon an 
elephant of war, and when he beheld Saum he fell upon his face and craved his 
blessing. And Saum blessed Rustem, the son of Zal.   
<p>Then Rustem spake unto Saum and said, "O Pehliva, I rejoice in that I am 
sprung from thee, for my desires are not after the feast, neither do I covet 
sleep or rest. My heart is fixed upon valour, a horse do I crave and a saddle, a 
coat of mail and a helmet, and my delight is in the arrow. Thine enemies will I 
vanquish, and may my courage be like unto thine."   
<p>And Saum, when he had heard these words, was astonished, and blessed Rustem 
yet again. And his eyes could not cease from gazing upon the face of the boy, 
and he lingered in the land until a moon had run her course.   
<p>Now it befell that when yet two springs had passed, Rustem was awakened from 
his slumber by a mighty roaring that shook the walls of the house, even unto the 
foundation, and a cry went forth that the white elephant of the King had broken 
its chain in fury, and that the housemates were in danger. And Rustem, when he 
learned it, sprang from his bed, and desired of the guards that they should 
suffer him to pass into the court that he might conquer the beast. But the 
guards barred the way from him, saying-   
<p>"How can we answer for it before the King if thou run into danger?"   
<p>But Rustem would not listen to their voice. He forced a passage for himself 
with his mighty arms, with his strong fists he broke down the barriers of the 
door. And when he was without he beheld how that all the warriors were sore 
afraid of the elephant, because that he was mad with rage. And Rustem was 
ashamed for them in his soul, and he ran towards the beast with a loud cry. Then 
the elephant, when he saw him, raised his trunk to strike him, but Rustem beat 
him upon the head with his club, and smote him that he died. And when he had 
done this deed, he returned unto his bed and slept until the morning. But the 

news of his prowess spread throughout the house of the King and far into the 
land, even unto the realms of Saum. And Zal, and all men with him, rejoiced 
because a hero was arisen in Iran.   
<p>Now, while these things were passing in the house of Zal, in the land of 
Zaboulistan, Minuchihr made him ready to pass from the world, for he had reached 
twice sixty years. He called before him Nauder his son, and gave him wise 
counsels, and exhorted him that he should ever walk in the paths of wisdom. And 
he bade him rest his throne upon the strength of Saum and Zal, and the child 
that was sprung from their loins. Then when he had spoken, Minuchihr closed his 
eyes and sighed, and there remained of him only a memory in the world.   
<p>But Nauder forgot the counsels of his father. He vexed the land and reigned 
in anger, and cruel deeds were committed in his name, so that the people rose up 
and cried against the King. And men of might came unto Saum and laid before him 
their plaints, and the petitions of the people, and they prayed that he would 
wrest the crown from the head of Nauder, and place it upon his own. But Saum was 
sore grieved when he had heard these words, and he spake, saying-   
<p>"Not so, for it beseemeth me not to put out my hand after the crown, for 
Nauder is of the race of the Kaianides, and unto them is given majesty and 
might."   
<p>Then he girt his sword about his loins, and took with him a host, and rode 
before the face of the Shah. And when he was come unto him, Saum exhorted him 
with prayers and tears that he would turn him from the paths of evil. And Nauder 
listened unto the voice of Saum the Pehliva, and joy was abroad once more.   
<p>But the tidings spread, even into Turan, that Minuchihr the just was 
departed, and that the hand of Nauder was heavy upon the land. And Poshang, who 
was of the race of Tur, heard the news thereof with gladness, for he deemed that 
the time was ripe to remember the vengeance that was due unto the blood of his 
sire. Therefore he called about him his warriors, and bade them go forth to war 
against Iran, saying the time was come to avenge his father and draw unto 
himself the heritage. And while his son Afrasiyab made ready the host to fulfil 
the desire of his father, there spread the news that Saum the Pehliva had been 
gathered unto the dust, and that Zal tarried in his house to build him a tomb. 
And the news gave courage unto Afrasiyab and his men, and they made haste to 
gain the frontier.   
<p>But the grandson of Feridoun had learned of their coming, and he prepared him 
to meet the foes of his land. Then he sent forth an army that overshadowed the 
earth in its progress. But the army of Afrasiyab was great also, and it covered 
the ground like unto ants and locusts. And both hosts pitched their tents in the 
plains of Dehstan, and made them ready for the fight. And the horses neighed 
loud, and the pawing of their hoofs shook the deep places of the earth, and the 
dust of their trampling uprose even unto heaven. Then when they had put their 
men into array, they fell upon each other, and for two days did they rage in 
fierce combat, neither did the victory lean to either side. And the clamour and 
confusion were mighty, and earth and sky seemed blended into one. And the 
carnage was great, and blood flowed like water, and heads fell from their trunks 
like unto autumn leaves that are withered. But on the third day it came about 
that the upper hand was given unto the men of Turan, and Nauder the King, and 
the flower of his army with him, fell into the hands of the foe.   
<p>Then Afrasiyab cut off the head of Nauder the Shah, and sat himself down upon 
the throne of light. And he proclaimed himself lord of Iran, and required of all 
men that they should do him homage, and pour gifts before his face. But the 
people would not listen unto his voice, and they sent messengers into Seistan, 
and craved counsel of the Pehliva in their distress. And Zal, when he heard 
their tidings, cast aside the sorrow for Saum his father, and girded his loins 
in enmity against the son of Tur. And he bade the Iranians choose out Zew, the 
son of Thamasp, of the blood of Feridoun, of wisdom in speech, that he should 
rule over them on the throne of the Kaianides. And the people did as Zal 
commanded.   
<p>Now the throne of Feridoun grew young again under the sway of Zew. With power 
did he beat back the host of Turan, a covenant of peace did he wring from their 
hands. And it was written that the Jihun should divide the lands, and that the 
power of Zal the Pehliva should end where men take up their abode in tents. And 
Zew ruled rightly in the sight of Ormuzd, and God gave unto the land the key of 
abundance. Yet few were the years that he commanded with equity, and Garshasp 
his son reigned in his stead. But neither to him was it given to reign long with 
glory, and bitter fruit sprouted yet again from the tree of misfortune. For the 
throne of the Kaianides was empty, and Afrasiyab, when he learned thereof, 
followed the counsels of Poshang his father, and hurried him unto the land of 
Iran, that he might place himself upon the seat of power. And all the men of 
Iran, when they learned thereof, were sore afraid, and they turned them once 
again unto the son of Saum. And they spake unto him hard words, and heaped 
reproaches upon him that he had not averted these dangers from their heads. And 
Zal in his heart smiled at their ingratitude and lipwisdom, but he also sorrowed 
with them and with his land. And he spake, saying-   
<p>"I have ever done for you what was fitting and right, and all my life have I 
feared no enemy save only old age. But that enemy is now upon me, therefore I 
charge you that ye look unto Rustem to deliver you. Howbeit he shall be backed 
by the counsels of his father."   
<p>Then he called before him his son, who was yet of tender age, and he said 
unto him-   
<p>"O my son, thy lips still smell of milk, and thy heart should go out to 
pleasure. But the days are grave, and Iran looketh unto thee in its danger. I 
must send thee forth to cope with heroes."   
<p>And Rustem answered and said, "Thou knowest, O my father, that my desires are 
rather after war than pleasures. Give unto me, therefore, a steed of strength 
and the mace of Saum thy father, and suffer that I go out to meet the hosts of 
Ahriman."   
<p>Then Zal's heart laughed within him when he heard these words of manhood. And 
he commanded that all the flocks of horses, both from Zaboulistan and Cabul, be 
brought before his son, that he might choose from their midst his steed of 
battle. And they were passed in order before Rustem, and he laid upon the backs 
of each his hand of might to test them if they could bear his weight of valour. 
And the horses shuddered as they bent beneath his grasp, and sank upon their 
haunches in weakness. And thus did he do with them all in turn, until he came 
unto the flocks of Cabul. Then he perceived in their midst a mare mighty and 
strong, and there followed after her a colt like to its mother, with the chest 
and shoulders of a lion. And in strength it seemed like an elephant, and in 
colour it was as rose leaves that have been scattered upon a saffron ground. Now 
Rustem, when he had tested the colt with his eyes, made a running knot in his 
cord and threw it about the beast. And he caught the colt in the snare, though 
the mare defended it mightily. Then the keeper of the flock came before Rustem 
and said-   
<p>"O youth puissant and tall, take not, I counsel thee, the horse of 
another."   
<p>And Rustem answered him and asked, "To whom then pertaineth this steed? I see 
no mark upon its flanks."   
<p>And the keeper said, "We know not its master, but rumours are rife anent it 
throughout the land, and men name it the Rakush of Rustem. And I warn thee, the 
mother will never permit thee to ride on it. Three years has it been ready for 
the saddle, but none would she suffer to mount thereon."   
<p>Then Rustem, when he heard these words, swung himself upon the colt with a 
great bound. And the mare, when she saw it, ran at him and would have pulled him 
down, but when she had heard his voice she suffered it. And the rose-coloured 
steed bore Rustem along the plains like unto the wind. Then when he was 
returned, the son of Zal spake and said to the keeper-   
<p>"I pray thee, tell unto me what is the price of this dragon?"   
<p>But the keeper replied, "If thou be Rustem, mount him, and retrieve the 
sorrows of Iran. For his price is the land of Iran, and seated upon him thou 
wilt save the world."   
<p>And Rustem rejoiced in Rakush (whose name, being interpreted, meaneth the 
lightning), and Zal rejoiced with him, and they made them ready to stand against 
Afrasiyab.   
<p>Now it was in the time of roses, and the meadows smiled with verdure, when 
Zal led forth his hosts against the offspring of Tur. And the standard of Kawah 
streamed upon the breeze, and Mihrab marched on the left, and Gustahem marched 
on the right, and Zal went in the midst of the men, but Rustem went at the head 
of all. And there followed after him a number like to the sands of the sea, and 
the sounds of cymbals and bells made a noise throughout the land like unto the 
day of judgment, when the earth shall cry unto the dead, "Arise." And they 
marched in order even unto the shores of the river Rai, and the two armies were 
but some farsangs apart.   
<p>Albeit, when Afrasiyab heard that Rustem and Zal were come out against him, 
he was in nowise dismayed, for he said, "The son is but a boy, and the father is 
old; it will not, therefore, be hard for me to keep my power in Iran." And he 
made ready his warriors with gladness of heart.   
<p>But Zal, when he had drawn up his army in battle array, spake unto them, 
saying-   
<p>"O men valiant in fight, we are great in number, but there is wanting to us a 
chief, for we are without the counsels of a Shah, and verily no labour 
succeedeth when the head is lacking. But rejoice, and be not downcast in your 
hearts, for a Mubid hath revealed unto me that there yet liveth one of the race 
of Feridoun to whom pertaineth the throne, and that he is a youth wise and 
brave."   
<p>And when he had thus spoken, he turned him to Rustem and said-   
<p>"I charge thee, O my son, depart in haste for the Mount Alberz, neither tarry 
by the way. And wend thee unto Kai Kobad, and say unto him that his army 
awaiteth him, and that the throne of the Kaianides is empty."   
<p>And Rustem, when he had heard his father's command, touched with his 
eyelashes the ground before his feet, and straightway departed. In his hand he 
bare a mace of might, and under him was Rakush the swift of foot. And he rode 
till he came within sight of the Mount Alberz, whereon had stood the cradle of 
his father. Then he beheld at its foot a house beauteous like unto that of a 
king. And around it was spread a garden whence came the sounds of running 
waters, and trees of tall stature uprose therein, and under their shade, by a 
gurgling rill, there stood a throne, and a youth, fair like to the moon, was 
seated thereon. And round about him leaned knights girt with red sashes of 
power, and you would have said it was a paradise for perfume and beauty.   
<p>Now when those within the garden beheld the son of Zal ride by, they came out 
unto him and said-   
<p>"O Pehliva, it behoveth us not to let thee go farther before thou hast 
permitted us to greet thee as our guest. We pray thee, therefore, descend from 
off thy horse and drink the cup of friendship in our house."   
<p>But Rustem said, "Not so, I thank you, but suffer that I may pass unto the 
mountain with an errand that brooketh no delay. For the borders of Iran are 
encircled by the enemy, and the throne is empty of a king. Wherefore I may not 
stay to taste of wine."   
<p>Then they answered him, "If thou goest unto the mount, tell us, we pray thee, 
thy mission, for unto us is it given to guard its sides."   
<p>And Rustem replied, "I seek there a king of the seed of Feridoun, who 
cleansed the world of the abominations of Zohak, a youth who reareth high his 
head. I pray ye, therefore, if ye know aught of Kai Kobad, that ye give me 
tidings where I may find him."   
<p>Then the youth that sat upon the throne opened his mouth and said, "Kai Kobad 
is known unto me, and if thou wilt enter this garden and rejoice my soul with 
thy presence I will give thee tidings concerning him."   
<p>When Rustem heard these words he sprang from off his horse and came within 
the gates. And the youth took his hand and led him unto the steps of the throne. 
Then he mounted it yet again, and when he had filled a cup with wine, he pledged 
the guest within his gates. Then he gave a cup unto Rustem, and questioned him 
wherefore he sought for Kai Kobad, and at whose desire he was come forth to find 
him. And Rustem told him of the Mubids, and how that his father had sent him 
with all speed to pray the young King that he would be their Shah, and lead the 
host against the enemies of Iran. Then the youth, when he had listened to an 
end, smiled and said-   
<p>"O Pehliva, behold me, for verily I am Kai Kobad of the race of 
Feridoun!"   
<p>And Rustem, when he had heard these words, fell on the ground before his 
feet, and saluted him Shah. Then the King raised him, and commanded that the 
slaves should give him yet another cup of wine, and he bore it to his lips in 
honour of Rustem, the son of Zal, the son of Saum, the son of Neriman. And they 
gave a cup also unto Rustem, and he cried-   
<p>"May the Shah live for ever!" Then instruments of music rent the air, and joy 
spread over all the assembly. But when silence was fallen yet again, Kai Kobad 
opened his mouth and said-   
<p>"Hearken, O my knights, unto the dream that I had dreamed, and ye will know 
wherefore I called upon you this day to stand in majesty about my throne. For in 
my sleep I beheld two falcons white of wing, and they came out unto me from 
Iran, and in their beaks they bare a sunny crown. And the crown they placed upon 
my head. And behold now is Rustem come out unto me like to a white bird, and his 
father, the nursling of a bird, hath sent him, and they have given unto me the 
crown of Iran."   
<p>And Rustem, when he had heard this dream, said, "Surely thy vision was given 
unto thee of God! But now, I pray thee, up and tarry no longer, for the land of 
Iran groaneth sore and awaiteth thee with much travail."   
<p>So Kai Kobad listened to the desires of Rustem, and swung him upon his steed 
of war; and they rode day and night, until they came down from the hills unto 
the green plains that are watered by murmuring streams. And Rustem brought the 
King safely through the outposts of the enemy; and when the night was fallen, he 
led him within the tents of Zal, and none knew that he was come save only the 
Mubids. For seven days did they hold counsel together, and on the eighth the 
message of the stars was received with joy. And Zal made ready a throne of ivory 
and a banquet, and the crown of Iran was placed upon the head of the young Shah. 
Then the nobles came and did homage before him, and they revelled in wine till 
the night was far spent. And they prayed him that he would make him ready to 
lead them against the Turks. And Kai Kobad mustered the army and did as they 
desired.   
<p>And soon the battle raged hot and strong many days, and deeds of valour were 
done on either side; but the men of Turan could not stand against the men of 
Iran, neither could the strength of Rustem be broken. For he put forth the power 
of a lion, and his shadow extended for miles. And from that day men named him 
Tehemten (which being interpreted, meaneth the strong-limbed), for he did deeds 
of prowess in the sight of men. And Afrasiyab was discomfited, and fled before 
him, and his army followed after, and their hearts were bruised and full of 
care.   
<p>But the Iranians, when they beheld that their foes had vanished before them, 
turned them unto Kai Kobad and did homage before his throne. And Kai Kobad 
celebrated the victory with much pomp, as is the manner of kings; and he placed 
Rustem upon his right hand and Zal upon his left, and they feasted and made them 
merry with wine.   
<p>In the meantime Afrasiyab returned him unto Poshang his father, who was of 
the race of Tur. And he came before him right sorrowful and spake, saying-   
<p>"O King, whose name is glorious, thou didst evil to provoke this war. The 
land which Feridoun the great did give in ancient time unto Tur the valiant, it 
hath been delivered unto thee, and the partition was just. Why, therefore, 
seekest thou to enlarge thy border? Verily I say, if thou haste not to make 
peace with Iran, Kai Kobad will send out against us an army from the four 
quarters of the earth, and they will subdue us, and by our own act we shall make 
the land too narrow for us. For the world is not delivered of the race of Irij, 
and the noxious poison hath not been converted into honey. For when one dieth 
another taketh his place, and never do they leave the world without a master. 
And there is arisen of the race of Saum a warrior called Rustem, and none can 
withstand him. He hath broken the power of thine host, and the world hath not 
seen his like for stoutness; and withal he is but little more than a weanling. 
Ponder therefore, O King, how shall it be when he may be come to years of 
vigour. Surely I am a man who desireth to possess the world, the stay of thine 
army, and thy refuge in danger, but before this boy my power fadeth like unto 
the mists that rise above the hills."   
<p>When the King of Turan had listened to these words, the tears of bitterness 
fell from his eyes. Then he called before him a scribe and he bade him write a 
letter unto Kai Kobad, the Shah. And the scribe adorned it with many colours and 
fair designs. And the scribe wrote-   
<p>"In the name of Ormuzd, the ruler of the sun and moon, greeting and 
salutation unto Kai Kobad the gracious from the meanest of his servants. Listen 
unto me, O valiant Shah, and ponder the words that I shall write. May grace fall 
upon the soul of Feridoun, who wove the woof of our race! Why should we any 
longer hold the world in confusion? That which he fixed, surely it was right, 
for he parted the world with equity, and we do wrong before him when we depart 
from the grooves that he hath shaped. I pray thee, therefore, let us no longer 
speak of Tur and his evil acts unto Irij, for if Irij was the cause of our 
hates, surely by Minuchihr hath he been avenged. Let us return, then, within the 
bounds that Feridoun hath blest, and let us part the world anew, as it was 
parted for Tur, and Selim, and Irij. For wherefore should we seek the land of 
another, since in the end each will receive in heritage a spot no larger than 
his body? If then Kai Kobad will listen unto my prayer, let the Jihun be the 
boundary between us, and none of my people shall behold its waters, nay, not 
even in a dream, neither shall any Iranian cross its floods, save only in 
amity."   
<p>And the King put his seal upon the letter and sent it unto Kai Kobad, and the 
messenger bare with him rich gifts of jewels and steeds of Araby. And when Kai 
Kobad had read the letter he smiled in his spirit and said-   
<p>"Verily not my people sought out this war but Afrasiyab, who deemed that he 
could wrest unto himself the crown of Iran, and could subdue the masterless land 
unto his will. And he hath but followed in the footsteps of Tur his father, for 
even as he robbed the throne of Irij, so did Afrasiyab take from it Nauder the 
Shah. And I say to you that I need not make peace with you because of any fear, 
but I will do it because war is not pleasing unto me. I will give unto you, 
therefore, the farther side of the river, and it shall be a boundary between us, 
and I pray that Afrasiyab may find rest within his borders."   
<p>And Kai Kobad did according to his word. He drew up a fresh covenant between 
them, and planted a new tree in the garden of power. And the messenger took the 
writing unto Poshang, King of Turan, and Kai Kobad proclaimed that there was 
peace throughout the land.   
<p>Now for the space of an hundred years did Kai Kobad rule over Iran, and he 
administered his realm with clemency, and the earth was quiet before him, and he 
gat his people great honour, and I ask of you what king can be likened unto him? 
But when this time had passed, his strength waned, and he knew that a green leaf 
was about to fade. So he called before him Kai Kaous his son, and gave unto him 
counsels many and wise. And when he had done speaking he bade them make ready 
his grave, and he exchanged the palace for the tomb. And thus endeth the history 
of Kai Kobad the glorious. It behoveth us now to speak of his son.
