Peace reigned again within the
 borders of Iran, and P the sword slept in its 
scabbard, and Kai Khosrau ordered the world with wisdom. And men rejoiced that 
the glory of Turan had been brought low, and the Shah feasted his nobles in 
lightness of heart.   
<p>Now it came about one day that while they were shortening the hours with wine 
there entered in unto them the keeper of the curtains of the door. And he said 
that men from Arman stood without and craved an audience. Then Kai Khosrau bade 
that they be let in. So the men came before him, and they uttered cries of 
lamentation, and they fell down at his feet and implored his aid. And Kai 
Khosrau said-   
<p>"Who hath done you wrong?" Then the men answered, "Our wrong cometh unto us 
from the borders of Turan, for there issue forth thence wild boars that break 
into our fields and do destruction to our crops. And our fortunes are entwined 
with the ground, and no man can overcome these beasts. Wherefore, we pray thee, 
send forth a Pehliva that he may subdue them, for our land groaneth under this 
plague."   
<p>Then Kai Khosrau said, "It shall be done as you desire," and he dismissed 
them graciously. Then he called before him his treasurer, and bade him bring 
forth precious stones, and horses with girdles of gold, and rich brocades of 
Roum. And when they were placed before him he showed them to his nobles, and he 
said that whoever would go forth to combat the wild boars should not find him 
close-handed. But for a while none answered, for no man listed to go forth to 
battle with wild beasts. Then Byzun, the son of Gew, arose and spake, 
saying-   
<p>"If the Shah will grant leave unto me, I will go forth and slay these 
foes."   
<p>Now Gew was grieved thereat, because that Byzun was his only son, and he 
feared for his youth. Therefore he sought to restrain him. But Byzun suffered it 
not, and he said-   
<p>"O King, listen unto my desires; for though I be young in years, yet am I old 
in prudence, and I will do nought that is not fitting unto thy slave."   
<p>And Kai Khosrau granted his request, but he bade him take forth with him 
Girgin, the wise in counsel, that he should guide him aright. And Byzun did as 
the Shah desired, and they set forth unto the land of Arman.   
<p>Now when they were come unto the wood they rested them, and made a great 
fire, and drank wine until they were refreshed. Then Girgin would have laid him 
down to slumber. But Byzun said-   
<p>"Not so, let us go forth and seek the wild boars." Then Girgin said, "Go thou 
alone, for it is thou who hast engaged in this combat, and who hast taken to 
thyself the gifts of the Shah. Therefore it behoveth me only to look on."   
<p>When Byzun heard these words he was amazed, but he regarded them not, and he 
entered in upon the forest. And after a while he came upon the wild boars, and 
they fell upon him. But he slew them with his mace, and he reddened the ground 
with their gore, and he went after them, even unto their lairs, and not one of 
them did he suffer to escape. Then when he had done thus, he parted their mighty 
teeth from off their heads and hung them about his saddle, that the men of Iran 
might behold them. And after this he turned him back unto Girgin.   
<p>Now Girgin, when he beheld him mounted upon his horse, and bearing round his 
saddle the tokens of his triumph, was envious thereat. And with his mouth he 
gave him joy, but Ahriman took hold of his spirit. So he pondered all night long 
how he could lay a snare for Byzun. And when the morning was come he praised his 
prowess, and they quaffed wine together, and fair words were exchanged between 
them. Then Girgin said-   
<p>"This land is known unto me, for I sojourned here with Rustem. And I know 
that at the distance of two farsangs lies the garden of Afrasiyab, where his 
women go forth to keep the feast of spring. And I bethink me that the time is at 
hand. Wherefore, I say unto thee, let us go hence, and behold with our eyes the 
fair ones whom the King of Turan hideth behind his curtains."   
<p>Now these words inflamed the blood of Byzun, and he gave ear unto Girgin, for 
he was young, and he acted like a young man. So they set forth upon the road, 
and Girgin filled the mind of Byzun with feasts and with sounds of music. And 
when they were come unto the spot, Byzun burned with impatience to look upon the 
women of Afrasiyab. And Girgin feigned as though he would restrain his foot 
within the skirt of patience, but he rejoiced in secret, for he hoped that from 
this deed evil would arise. So Byzun sped forth unto the garden, and he hid 
himself beneath the shade of a tall cypress, and he feasted his eyes upon the 
beauty of the women. And the garden was clad in its robes of spring, and the 
world was green and fair, and all the air was filled with the sweet sounds of 
music and of song. And there moved amid the rose-bushes maidens of Peri face, 
and in stature they were like to the cypress-trees, and one was exalted above 
them all. And she was daughter unto Afrasiyab, and Manijeh was she named.   
<p>Now it came about that as Manijeh stood at the door of her tent she beheld 
Byzun where he was hid. And she marvelled at his beauty, and her heart was 
captive unto him. So she called about her her maidens, and said-   
<p>"Go forth and question the stranger who regardeth us, for I bethink me that 
he is a Peri, or that Saiawush is come back unto the earth, for no mortal can 
own such beauty, neither can any man enter here."   
<p>Then one went forth and bare unto Byzun this message. And his heart leaped 
thereat, and he said-   
<p>"Say unto your mistress that I am come forth from Iran to slay the wild boars 
of Arman. And I came hither that perchance I might gaze upon the face of the 
daughter of Afrasiyab, for tidings of her beauty were told unto me, and reached 
even unto Iran. Go, therefore, and ask if I may speak with her."   
<p>Then the handmaidens did as Byzun desired, and Manijeh said, "Let him come 
forth."   
<p>So Byzun entered into the tents of Manijeh, and she received him with joy, 
and she caused his feet to be washed with musk and amber, and she poured jewels 
before him, and prepared for him a feast of sweet meats. And slaves stood around 
and made soft music, and the heart of Byzun was ensnared in the meshes of the 
net that had been spread. And three days and three nights did he sojourn beside 
Manijeh, and his passion for her waxed greater, and he thought not of Iran, 
neither of the time of departure. And Manijeh too rejoiced in his presence, and 
when the time was come for her to quit the garden of spring she would not part 
with him. So she gave unto him a cup wherein she had mingled a potion. And the 
wine caused Byzun to sleep, and while he slept the maidens bare him in a litter 
even into the house of Afrasiyab. And Manijeh hid him behind the curtains of the 
women, and none, save only her handmaidens, were aware of his presence.   
<p>Now when Byzun awoke he asked whither he was come, and when he learned that 
he was in the house of Afrasiyab he was afraid, and desired to return unto Iran. 
But Manijeh quieted his distrust, and he forgot his fears in her love. And she 
made the earth glad about him, and the hours fled on the wings of wine and of 
joy. And many days sped thus, and none knew what passed in the house of the 
women.   
<p>Then it came about that a guardian of the door learned thereof, and he came 
before Afrasiyab, and told unto him that his daughter hid within her house a man 
of the race of Iran. And Afrasiyab, when he learned it, was beside himself with 
anger, and he cursed Manijeh, and he said-   
<p>"The hour is come unto this man." Then he called for Gersiwaz, his brother, 
and bade him go forth with a band of armed men unto the house of the women. And 
Gersiwaz did as Afrasiyab commanded, and he put guards at all the doors. Then 
the sounds of lutes and of rejoicing fell upon his ear, for none were aware of 
the vengeance that was come upon them. And when Gersiwaz was come unto the house 
of Manijeh, the daughter of Afrasiyab, he brake open the doors, and stood in the 
midst of the revels. And he beheld within the chamber many slaves playing on 
lutes of gold, and fair women that handed the wine-cups. And Manijeh was seated 
upon a throne of gold, and beside her was Byzun, the son of Gew, the Iranian, 
and joy was painted on his visage.   
<p>Now when Gersiwaz beheld Byzun, he cried, "O vile man, thou art fallen into 
my hands! How wilt thou now save thy life? "   
<p>And Byzun was dismayed, for he had neither sword nor armour, and he thought 
within himself-   
<p>"I fear me that my life will end this day." But he drew forth from his boot a 
dagger that was hidden therein, and he threatened Gersiwaz, and he said that he 
would plunge it into his breast if he led him not before Afrasiyab.   
<p>Now Gersiwaz knew that Byzun was quick to act, and would do that which he 
spake, so he held back from combat, and he seized Byzun and bound him, and led 
him before Afrasiyab. And when Afrasiyab saw him in such plight, he said-   
<p>"O man of evil, wherefore didst thou come into my land?"   
<p>Then Byzun told him how he was gone forth to slay the boars, and how he was 
come into the garden of Afrasiyab, and he said that a Peri had borne him unto 
the palace, for he would not do hurt unto Manijeh. But Afrasiyab refused belief 
unto his words, and he commanded that a gibbet should be raised without his 
court, and that Byzun be hung thereon, because he had dishonoured the house of 
the women, and had stolen like a thief in the night into the house of the King. 
And in vain did Byzun invoke mercy at the hands of Afrasiyab, and he was led 
forth beyond the courts. And the men of Afrasiyab made ready the gallows, and 
Byzun stood bound beneath. And he wept sore in his distress, and he prayed to 
the winds that they would bear tidings of him unto the Shah of Iran, and he 
sware that his death should be avenged upon Turan.   
<p>Now while he waited thus there passed by Piran, the Pehliva, who was come 
forth to do homage unto the King. And when he beheld the gibbet he questioned 
concerning it, and when he learned that it was for Byzun he was troubled. So he 
got him from his horse and came near unto the youth, and questioned him of this 
adventure. And Byzun told him all that was come about, and how his evil comrade 
had laid for him a snare. Then Piran commanded that punishment be stayed until 
he should have spoken unto Afrasiyab. And he went in and stood before the King 
as a suppliant. Then Afrasiyab bade him make known his desires. And Piran opened 
his mouth and spake words of wisdom unto Afrasiyab, his King. And he reminded 
him of the death of Saiawush, and how Byzun was of much account in his own 
country, and how surely his blood would be avenged. And he said how the land of 
Turan was not ready to stand again in a new war, and he prayed Afrasiyab to 
content him with a dungeon. And he said-   
<p>"Heap chains upon Byzun, and let the earth hide him, that Iran may not know 
whither he is vanished."   
<p>Now Afrasiyab knew that the words of Piran were wise, and he gave ear unto 
them. So Byzun was led forth unto a desert place and he was laden with chains of 
iron and his tender flesh was bound and he was thrown into a deep hole. And the 
opening thereof was closed with a mighty stone that the Dev Akwan had torn from 
the nethermost sea, and neither sun nor moon could be seen by Byzun, and 
Afrasiyab trusted that his reason would forsake him in this pit. And when he had 
done thus unto Byzun, he bade Gersiwaz go in unto the house of the daughter that 
had dishonoured him, and tear off her costly robes, and her crown, and her veil. 
And he said-   
<p>"Let her be cast forth also into the desert, that she may behold the dungeon 
wherein Byzun is hid. And say unto her, 'Thou hast been his Spring, be now his 
comforter, and wait upon him in his narrow prison."'   
<p>And Gersiwaz did as Afrasiyab commanded, and he tore the veil from off 
Manijeh, and he caused her to walk barefooted unto the spot where Byzun was 
hid.   
<p>Now Manijeh was bowed down with sorrow, and she wept sore, and she wandered 
through the desert day and night bewailing her fate. And ever did she return 
unto the pit, and she sought how she might enter therein. But she could not move 
the mighty stone that closed its mouth. Yet after some days were gone by she 
found an opening where she could thrust in her hand. Now when she had found it 
she rejoiced, and daily she went forth unto the city and begged of men that they 
would give her bread. And none knew her for the daughter of Afrasiyab, but all 
had pity upon her sorry plight, and they gave her freely of that which they had. 
And she returned with it unto Byzun, and she fed him through the hole that she 
had made. And she spake unto him sweet words of comfort, and she kept his heart 
alive within him.   
<p>Now while these things were passing in Turan, Girgin was returned unto Iran 
much discomfited. And he pondered how he should come before the Shah, and what 
he should say unto Gew. And he told them that they had of their combined 
strength overcome the boars, and he boasted that he had done deeds of great 
prowess, and he said that a wild ass was come forth out of the forest and had 
borne away Byzun from before his eyes, and verily he held that it must be a 
Dev. Then Kai Khosrau questioned him closely, and when he had done so he saw 
that Girgin held not unto his story. So his mind misgave him, and he commanded 
that Girgin be put in chains. And he said-   
<p>"I will guard thee until I have learned tidings of Byzun."   
<p>Now Gew was beside himself with grief because of his only son, whom he loved, 
but Kai Khosrau spake comfort unto his soul. And he bade riders go forth unto 
all corners of the wind to seek tidings of Byzun, and he said-   
<p>"If I learn nought concerning him until the feast of Neurouz be come, I will 
search for him in the crystal globe wherein I can behold the world, and read the 
secrets of destiny."   
<p>Now when the horsemen had sought Byzun in vain throughout the plains of Iran 
and in the gorges of the land of Arman, they returned them unto the courts of 
the Shah. So when the feast of Neurouz was come, Kai Khosrau clothed himself in 
a robe of Roum, and he took from off his head the crown of the Kaianides, and he 
presented himself in humility before Ormuzd. Then he took in his hand the globe 
of crystal, and he prayed to God that He would grant unto him to behold the 
seven zones of the world. And God granted it. And Kai Khosrau surveyed all the 
lands of the earth, and nowhere upon them could he behold Byzun. And he was 
downcast and sad in his spirit, for he deemed that Byzun was departed from the 
world. Then Ormuzd showed unto him where he was hidden in a pit, and Kai Khosrau 
beheld him, and the damsel that watched beside him. So he called before him Gew, 
and said-   
<p>"Let thy heart cease from sorrow, for thy son liveth, and he is tended by a 
maiden of noble birth. But he is bound, and a mighty stone is laid above his 
prison, and Rustem alone can deliver him. Wherefore I counsel thee, speed forth 
unto Zaboulistan and entreat the son of Zal that he come unto our aid yet 
again."   
<p>Then Kai Khosrau wrote a letter unto Rustem, wherein he told him all that was 
come about, and he gave the writing unto Gew. And Gew sped forth therewith unto 
Zaboulistan.   
<p>Now when he was come within the courts of Rustem, Zal beheld him from afar, 
and he feared that evil was come upon Iran since the Shah sent forth a man of 
might like unto Gew to be his messenger. So he came forth in haste and 
questioned him. And when he learned his mission he bade him come within, and he 
told him how Rustem was gone forth to chase the wild ass, and he made a feast 
for him, and entertained him until his son was returned within the courts. Now 
when Rustem learned the tidings, his eyes were filled with tears, but he spake 
comfort unto Gew, and he said-   
<p>"Be not disquieted, for verily Rustem shall not remove the saddle from Rakush 
until he hath grasped the hand of Byzun, and broken his chains and his 
prison."   
<p>And when he had read the letter of the Shah, he made him ready to go, before 
Kai Khosrau. And when he was come into his presence, he did obeisance before 
him, and he said-   
<p>"O King of kings, I am ready to do thy commandments, for my mother brought me 
into the world that I might weary myself for thee, and unto thee pertaineth rest 
and joy, and unto me combat everlasting."   
<p>Then he chose forth from among the warriors men of renown, that they should 
go out with him to deliver Byzun. And Girgin sent greeting unto Rustem, and 
craved of him that he would plead for him with the Shah. And he bewailed his 
fault, and he entreated that he might go out to succour Byzun. And Rustem asked 
his forgiveness of Kai Khosrau, and when the Shah would have refused his suit, 
he pressed him hard. So Kai Khosrau listened to the desires of his Pehliva. Then 
he said unto him-   
<p>"Tell me what men and treasures thou desirest to bear with thee into 
Turan."   
<p>And Rustem said, "I desire not a large army, for I think to regain Byzun by 
the arts of wile. Give unto me, therefore, jewels and rich brocades, and 
carpets, and stuffs of value, for I purpose to go forth in the garb of a 
merchant."   
<p>Then Kai Khosrau gave him the key to all his treasures, and Rustem chose 
forth rich stuffs, and loaded them upon an hundred camels. And he desired seven 
valiant knights that they should go forth with him clad in the dress of 
merchants, and that an army be posted in secret upon the borders. And when all 
was ready the caravan went forth. And they journeyed until they came into the 
town of Khoten, and all the people came forth to gaze upon their merchandise. 
Then Rustem, in his disguise, went unto the house of Piran, and he poured gifts 
before him, and he asked leave of him that he might remain within the borders to 
sell his wares. And Piran granted his request. So Rustem took for himself a 
house, and showed his goods unto the people, and bartered them, and it was 
noised through all the land that a caravan was come out from Iran, and all who 
had need of aught flocked into the city. And the news spread even unto the ears 
of Manijeh. And when she learned that it was men of Iran who were come forth, 
she made her way unto the city, and came before Rustem and questioned him, 
saying-   
<p>"What news is there abroad in Iran concerning Byzun, the son of Gew, and doth 
no army come forth to save him? O noble merchant, I entreat of thee when thou 
goest back to thy land, to seek out Gew, and Kai Khosrau, and Rustem the mighty, 
and bring unto them tidings of Byzun, lest he perish in his chains."   
<p>Now Rustem, when he heard her words, was afraid for his secret, for he knew 
not who she was. Wherefore he spoke roughly unto her, and he said-   
<p>"I am a man of peace and of ignoble birth, a merchant, and I know nought of 
Gew, or of Byzun, or of the Shah. Get thee hence, maiden, thou dost but hinder 
my business, and this alone concerneth me."   
<p>When he had thus spoken, Manijeh looked on him with sorrow, and wept, 
saying-   
<p>"Do the men of Iran refuse tidings unto the poor?" Then Rustem repented him 
of his harshness, and said- "Woman, who art thou, and how do these things regard 
thee? "   
<p>And he caused food to be put before her, and he comforted her with kind 
words. Then Manijeh said-   
<p>"I am daughter unto Afrasiyab, and my father hath cast me forth because of 
Byzun."   
<p>And she told him all that was come about, and how she had tended her beloved, 
and how she had kept him alive. And she related unto Rustem how he languished in 
his chains, and how they put their trust alone in Rustem the Pehliva. And she 
said-   
<p>"When it was told unto me that men from Iran were come forth, I sped hither 
unto thee, for I hoped that tidings of Byzun might come thus unto the mighty 
warrior."   
<p>When Rustem heard her words he was moved with compassion. And when he had 
spoken softly unto her, he gave to her savoury meats, and he bade her bear them 
unto Byzun. Now within the body of a fowl he had hidden a ring whereon was 
graven his seal. And when Byzun came upon it, and felt the ring, and that it 
bare the name of Rustem, his heart laughed within him, for he knew that the end 
of his ills was come. And his lips laughed also, and his laughter shook the 
walls of the pit.   
<p>Now when Manijeh heard his laughter she was amazed, and she feared lest his 
wits were distraught, and she leaned over the mouth of the pit and spake, 
saying-   
<p>"O man of ill fortune, wherefore is thy heart thus light, thou who seest 
neither sun, nor moon, nor stars?"   
<p>Then Byzun answered and said, "Hope is sprung up in my breast."   
<p>And Manijeh said, "Whence dost thou behold the rays of hope?"   
<p>And Byzun answered, "I know not whether I can confide it unto thee, for a 
woman cannot keep a secret."   
<p>Now Manijeh was pained at these words, and she upbraided Byzun, and recalled 
to him all she had suffered for his sake. And Byzun repented him of his hasty 
speech, for he knew that she was prudent and strong of spirit. So he said-   
<p>"Swear unto me a great oath, and I will tell it unto thee."   
<p>And Manijeh sware. Then Byzun said- "I know that the merchant who is come 
forth from Iran is come out because of me. Go therefore again into his presence, 
and say unto him, 'O Pehliva of the King of kings, tell unto me, art thou the 
master of Rakush?' "   
<p>Now Manijeh, when she had heard these words, sped forth to do the bidding of 
Byzun. And she came before Rustem, and spake to him the words that had been told 
her. And he answered and said-   
<p>"Go say unto thy friend, verily I am the master of Rakush, and that I am come 
forth to deliver him."   
<p>Then he bade her gather together wood into a pyre, and set light thereto when 
the night should be come, that he might know where Byzun was laid. And Manijeh 
did as Rustem commanded, and she wearied not to scour the land, and she stripped 
the trees of their branches, and her tender body was torn of thorns; but she 
bare all gladly for the sake of Byzun, whom she loved. And when the night was 
fallen she set light unto the wood, and Rustem came forth unto the spot, and his 
seven comrades came with him. And each strove in turn to lift the stone that 
closed the pit, but none could roll it aside. Then Rustem prayed to God that He 
would grant him strength, and he came unto the mouth of the pit, and he bent 
down his body, and he spake unto Byzun, and questioned him how he was come into 
these straits. Then he said-   
<p>"I would ask of thee a boon. Grant thy forgiveness unto Girgin, if it be 
given unto me to move this stone, and to free thee from out of this pit. For 
verily he repenteth him of his evil deed, and because he is valiant I would that 
there should be peace between you."   
<p>But Byzun said, "Thou knowest not all the evil that Girgin hath brought upon 
me. I cannot give ear unto thy request, for I desire to take vengeance upon 
him."   
<p>Then Rustem said, "If thy mind be thus evil that thou wilt not listen to my 
desires, nor remember how I am come forth in friendship to succour thee, I shall 
mount upon Rakush and leave thee to perish in thy chains."   
<p>When Byzun heard these words he gave a loud cry, and bewailed his evil 
plight. And he said, "Be it as thou desirest."   
<p>Then Rustem laid hold of the stone, and he put forth all his strength, and he 
lifted it from off the mouth of the pit and threw it far into the desert. Then 
he let down his cord and enmeshed Byzun therein, and drew him forth from his 
dungeon. And he was a sorry sight to see, for the earth had withered his body, 
and his skin hung about his bones.   
<p>Now Rustem, when he had broken the chains of Byzun, covered him with a cloak 
and set him upon a horse, and he took Manijeh also, and led them unto his house 
in the city. Then when he had refreshed them with water, and covered them with 
new robes, he desired that they be led unto the spot where the army was hidden. 
And he said unto Byzun-   
<p>"I desire to fall upon Turan, but thou art too wasted to fight."   
<p>But Byzun said, "Not so; let Manijeh go forth into shelter, but it behoveth 
not a man to be guarded like a woman."   
<p>And he refused ear to the desires of Rustem, and he clad him in a coat of 
mail, and he girded him to ride beside the Pehliva. And they went forth in the 
darkness until they were come unto the house of Afrasiyab. And when they were 
come there, Rustem lifted the doors from off their hinges and entered into the 
precincts, and he slew the guards that kept the curtains, and he made him a 
passage unto the chamber of Afrasiyab. And when he stood therein he lifted up 
his voice of thunder, and he cried-   
<p>"Sleep, man of folly, and may thy slumbers be deep. Thou hast rested upon thy 
throne while Byzun was hidden in a pit. But thou hast forgotten that a road 
leadeth from Iran into Turan, and thou didst think in thine evil heart that none 
would come forth to avenge him. Listen, therefore, unto my voice; for I am 
Rustem, the son of Zal, the Pehliva, and I have broken down thy doors, and 
released Byzun from his chains, and I am come to do vengeance upon thee."   
<p>When Afrasiyab heard these words he awoke, and cried out in his fear. And he 
called upon the names of his guards. But no man came forth, because they had 
been laid low by the hands of Rustem. Then Afrasiyab made his way unto the door, 
and because it was dark he escaped thence, and he fled before the face of 
Rustem, and left his house between his hands. Then Rustem took much rich booty 
of slaves, and horses, and jewels, and when he had done so he sped back unto his 
army, for he knew that with the day Afrasiyab would come forth with an host to 
assail him. And it came about as he foresaw, and when the day was risen the 
watchers cried out that an army marched forth from Turan. Then Rustem set his 
men in battle order, and he sent Manijeh and the slaves and the booty into Iran, 
and he placed himself at the head of the host, and Byzun rode beside him. And 
there was fought a mighty battle, and great was the slaughter, and the bodies of 
the slain and the broken armour covered the earth. And the banner of Turan sank, 
and Afrasiyab fled before his enemies.   
<p>Then Rustem returned with joy unto Kai Khosrau, and the Shah was glad also. 
And he came forth to greet his Pehliva, and there rode with him Gew and Gudarz, 
his warriors. And when Kai Khosrau saw Rustem he embraced him, and said-   
<p>"O stay of my soul, and man of valour, thou resemblest the sun, for 
wheresoever men may look they behold the traces of thy mighty deeds. Happy is 
Zal who owneth a son such as thou!"   
<p>Then he blessed him, and showered rich gifts upon him; and Gew blessed him 
also, and Gudarz, because he had brought back Byzun into their midst. Then Kai 
Khosrau gave orders that a great feast be prepared, and the heroes drank until 
their heads were heavy with wine. But in the morning Rustem came before the Shah 
in audience, and opened his mouth and said-   
<p>"May it please the King to lend his ear unto his slave. I desire to return 
unto Zal, my father."   
<p>And Kai Khosrau listened to the just desires of Rustem, though he would fain 
have kept him in his courts.   
<p>Now when Rustem was departed, Kai Khosrau called before him Byzun, and he 
spake to him of that which was come about, and he poured pity upon the daughter 
of Afrasiyab when he learned all she had suffered for the sake of Byzun; and he

<p>"Cherish this woman in thy bosom, and suffer not that grief come nigh unto 
her, neither speak to her cold words, for she hath endured much for thee. And 
may thy life beside her be happy."   
<p>And when the Shah had thus spoken he dismissed Byzun from his presence.   
<p>Thus endeth the history of Byzun and Manijeh.
