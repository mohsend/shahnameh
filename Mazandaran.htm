<p>
Kai aous seated him on the crystal throne, and the world was obedient to his 
will. But Ahriman was angry that his power was so long broken in Iran, and he 
sware unto himself that happiness should no longer smile upon the land. And he 
imagined guile in his black heart.   
<p>Now it came about one day that the Shah sat in his trellised bower in the 
garden of roses, drinking wine and making merry with his court. Then Ahriman, 
when he beheld that they were thus forgetful of care, saw that the time served 
him. So he sent forth a Dev clad as a singer, and bade him ask for audience 
before the Shah. And the Dev did as he was bidden. And he came before the 
servants of the King, and begged for entrance into the arbour of flowers.   
<p>"For verily," he said, "I am a singer of sweet songs, and I come from 
Mazandaran, and desire to pour my homage at the throne of my lord."   
<p>Now when Kai Kaous learned that a singer waited without, he commanded that he 
should be brought in. Then he gave him wine and permitted him to open his mouth 
before him. Now the Dev, when he had done homage before the Shah, warbled unto 
his lyre words of deep cunning. And he sang how that no land was like unto his 
own for beauty and riches, and he inflamed the desires of the Shah after 
Mazandaran. And Ahriman fanned the flame within the mind of the King, and when 
the Dev had ended, Kai Kaous was become uplifted in his heart, like unto 
Jemshid. So he turned him unto his warriors and said-   
<p>"O my friends, mighty and brave, we have abandoned ourselves unto feasting, 
we have revelled in the arms of peace. But it behoveth not men to live long in 
this wise, lest they grow idle and weak. And above all it behoveth not me that 
am a Shah, for the Shah is called to be a hero among men, and the world should 
be his footstool. Now verily the power and splendour of Jemshid was lower than 
mine, and my wealth surpasseth that of Zohak and Kai Kobad. It beseemeth me 
therefore to be greater also than they in prowess, and to be master of 
Mazandaran, which ever resisted their might. I bid you therefore make ready for 
combat, and I will lead you into the land whereof this singer hath sung so 
sweetly."   
<p>Now the nobles, when they had heard these words, grew pale with fear, for 
there was not one among them who listed to combat with Devs. But none durst 
open their lips in answer, yet their hearts were full of fear and their mouths 
of sighs. But at last, when they could keep silence no longer, some spake and 
said-   
<p>"Lord, we are thy servants, and that which thou biddest surely we must 
do."   
<p>But among themselves they took counsel how they should act if the Shah held 
firm by his desire. And they recalled how not even Jemshid in his pride had 
thought to conquer the Devs of Mazandaran, before whom the sword hath no power 
and wisdom no avail, neither had Feridoun, learned in magic, or Minuchihr the 
mighty, ventured on this emprise. Then they bethought them of Zal the son of 
Saum, and they sent forth a wind-footed dromedary and a messenger. And they said 
unto Zal-   
<p>"Haste, we pray thee, neither tarry to cleanse thine head though it be 
covered with dust; for Ahriman hath strown evil seed in the heart of Kai Kaous, 
and it ripeneth to fruit already, and already it hath borne fruit, and Iran is 
threatened with danger. But we look to thee that thou speak words of good 
counsel unto the Shah, and avert these sorrows from our heads."   
<p>Now Zal was sore distressed when he learned that a leaf on the tree of the 
Kaianides was thus faded. And he said-   
<p>"Kai Kaous is void of knowledge, and the sun must revolve yet oft above his 
head before he learneth the wisdom of the great. For unto true wisdom alone is 
it given to know when to strike and when to tarry. But he is like unto a child 
who deemeth the world will tremble if it but upraiseth its sword. And but for my 
duty unto God and unto Iran, I would abandon him to his folly."   
<p>Then Zal revolved in his mind this trouble even until the sun was set. But 
when the glory of the world was arisen yet again, he girt his sash about his 
loins, and took in his hand the mace of might and set forth unto the throne of 
the Shah. And he craved for audience, and prostrated himself before the King. 
And when Kai Kaous permitted it, Zal opened his mouth and spake words of wisdom. 
And he said-   
<p>"O King powerful and great, word is come unto me, even unto Seistan, of thy 
device. But it seemeth unto me that mine ears have not heard aright. For 
Mazandaran is the abode of Devs, and no man can overcome their skill. Give not, 
therefore, unto the wind thy men and thy treasures. Turn, I pray thee, from this 
scheme, neither plant in the garden of Iran the tree of folly, whose leaves are 
curses and whose fruits are evil, for thus did not the kings before thee."   
<p>Then Kai Kaous, when he had listened, said, "I despise not thy counsel, nor 
do I bid thee hold thy peace, for thou art a pillar unto Iran. But neither shall 
thy words divert me from my desire, and Mazandaran shall pay tribute to my 
hands. For thou considerest not how that my heart is bolder and my might more 
great than that of my fathers before me. I go, therefore, and the kingdom will I 
leave between thy hands and those of Rustem thy son."   
<p>When Zal heard these words, and beheld that Kai Kaous was firm in his 
purpose, he ceased from opposing. Then he bowed him unto the dust, and spake, 
saying-   
<p>"O Shah, it is thine to command, and whether it be just or unjust, thy 
servants serve thee even unto death. I have spoken the words that weighed upon 
my heart. Three things it is not given to do, even unto a king: to elude death, 
to bind up the eye of destiny, to live without nurture. Mayst thou never repent 
thee of thy resolve, mayst thou never regret my counsels in the hour of danger, 
may the might of the Shah shine for ever!"   
<p>And when he had ended, Zal went out of the presence of the King, and he was 
right sorrowful, and the nobles mourned with him when they learned how nought 
had been accomplished.   
<p>Then, ere the day succeeded unto the night, Kai Kaous set forth with his 
horsemen unto Mazandaran.   
<p>Now when they were come within its borders, Kai Kaous commanded Gew that he 
should choose forth a strong band from out their midst, and go before the city 
with mighty clubs. And he bade him destroy the dwellers of the town, neither 
should they spare the women nor the young, because that they too were the 
children of Devs. And Gew did as the Shah commanded. Then clubs rained down 
upon the people like to hail, and the city that resembled a garden was changed 
into a desert, and all the inmates thereof perished at the hands of the enemy, 
neither did they find any mercy in their eyes. But when the men of Iran had 
ceased from killing, they sent news thereof unto the Shah, and told him of the 
riches that were hidden within the palaces.   
<p>And Kai Kaous said, "Blessed be he who sang to me of the glories of this 
realm."   
<p>And he marched after Gew with the rest of his host, and seven days did they 
never cease from plundering, neither could they be sated with the gold and 
jewels that they found. But on the eighth the tidings of their deeds pierced 
unto the King of Mazandaran, and his heart was heavy with care. He therefore 
sent a messenger unto the mountains where dwelt the White Dev, who was powerful 
and strong, and he entreated him that he would come unto his succour, or verily 
the land would perish under the feet of Iran.   
<p>The White Dev, when he heard the message, uprose like to a mountain in his 
strength, and he said-   
<p>"Let not the King of Mazandaran be troubled, for surely the hosts of Iran 
shall vanish at my approach."   
<p>Then, when the night was fallen, he spread a dark cloud, heavy and thick, 
over the land, and no light could pierce it, neither could fires be seen across 
its midst, and you would have said the world was steeped in pitch. And the army 
of Iran was wrapt in a tent of blackness. Then the Dev caused it to rain stones 
and javelins, and the Iranians could not behold their source, neither could they 
defend themselves or stand against the arts of magic. And they wandered astray 
in their distress, and no man could find his fellow, and their hearts were 
angered against the Shah for this emprise. But when the morning was come, and 
glory was arisen upon the world, they could not see it, for the light of their 
eyes was gone out. And Kai Kaous too was blinded, and he wept sore, and the 
whole army wept with him in their anguish. And the Shah cried in his 
distress-   
<p>"O Zal, O my Pehliva wise and great, wherefore did I shut mine ear unto thy 
voice!"   
<p>And the army echoed his words in their hearts, but their lips were silent for 
boundless sorrow.   
<p>Then the White Dev spake unto Kai Kaous with a voice of thunder, and he 
said-   
<p>"O King, thou hast been struck like to a rotten trunk, on thine own head 
alone resteth this destruction, for thou hast attained unto Mazandaran, and 
entered the land after which thy heart desired."   
<p>And he bade his legion guard the Shah and all his army, and he withheld from 
them wine and good cheer, and gave unto them but enough for sustenance, for he 
desired not that they should die, but gloried in their wretchedness. Then when 
he had so done he sent tidings thereof unto the King of Mazandaran. And he bade 
the King take back the booty and rejoice in the defeat of Iran. And he 
counselled him that he suffer not Kai Kaous to perish, that he might learn to 
know good fortune from ill. And the White Dev bade the King sing praises unto 
Ahriman the mighty, who had sent him unto his aid. And having spoken thus he 
returned him unto his home in the mountains, but the King of Mazandaran rejoiced 
in his spoils.   
<p>Now Kai Kaous remained in the land after which he had yearned, and his heart 
was heavy with bitterness. And the eyes of his soul were opened, and he cried 
continually, "This fault is mine;" and he cast about in his spirit how he might 
release his host from the hands of the Devs. But the Devs guarded him 
straitly, and he could send no messenger into Iran. Howbeit it came about that a 
messenger escaped their borders, and bore unto Zal the writing of Kai Kaous the 
afflicted. And Kai Kaous bowed himself in his spirit unto the dust before Zal, 
and he wrote to him all that was come about, and how that he and his host were 
blind and captive, and he poured forth his repentance, and he said-   
<p>"I have sought what the foolish seek, and found what they find. And if thou 
wilt not gird thy loins to succour me, I perish indeed."   
<p>When Zal heard this message he gnawed his hands in vexation. Then he called 
before him Rustem, and said-   
<p>"The hour is come to saddle Rakush and to avenge the world with thy sword. As 
for me, I number two hundred years, and have no longer the strength to fight 
with Devs. But thou art young and mighty. Cast about thee, therefore, thy 
leopard-skin and deliver Iran from bondage."   
<p>And Rustem said, "My sword is ready, and I will go hence as thou dost bid. 
Yet of old, O my father, the mighty did not go forth of their own will to fight 
the powers of hell, neither doth one who is not weary of this world go into the 
mouth of a hungry lion. But if God be with me I shall overcome the Devs and 
gird our army anew with the sashes of might. And I pray that His blessing rest 
upon me."   
<p>Then Zal, when he heard these noble words, blessed his son, and prayed that 
Ormuzd too would give him his blessing. And he bestowed on him wise counsel, and 
told him how he could come unto the land of Mazandaran. And he said-   
<p>"Two roads lead unto this kingdom, and both are hard and fraught with danger. 
The one taken of Kai Kaous is the safest, but it is long, and it behoveth 
vengeance to be fleet. Choose therefore, I charge thee, the shorter road, though 
it be beset with baleful things, and may Ormuzd return thee safe unto mine 
arms."   
<p>When Rustem had drunk in the counsels of his father he seated him on Rakush 
the fleet of foot. But when he would have departed, his mother came out before 
him, and she made great wailing that Rustem should go before the evil Devs. And 
she would have hindered him, but Rustem suffered her not. He comforted her with 
his voice, and bade her be of good cheer. He showed unto her how that he had not 
of his own choice chosen this adventure. And he bade her rest her hopes in God. 
And when he had done speaking she let him depart, but the heart of Rudabeh 
yearned after her son, and her eyes were red with weeping many days.   
<p>In the meanwhile the young hero of the world sped forth to do his duty unto 
the Shah. And Rakush caused the ground to vanish under his feet, and in twelve 
hours was a two days' journey accomplished. Then when eve was fallen, Rustem 
ensnared a wild ass, and made a fire and roasted it for his meal. And when he 
had done he released Rakush from the bonds of his saddle and prepared for 
himself a couch among the reeds, neither was he afraid of wild beasts or of 
Devs.   
<p>But in the reeds was hidden the lair of a fierce lion, and the lion when he 
returned unto his haunt beheld the tall man and the horse that watched beside 
him. And he rejoiced at the fat meal that he held was in store. And he thought 
within his mind, "I will first subdue the steed, then the rider will be an easy 
prey." And he fell upon Rakush. But Rakush defended himself mightily. With his 
hoofs did he trample upon the forehead of the lion, with his sharp teeth did he 
tear his skin, and he trampled upon him till he died. But the noise of the 
struggle had wakened Rustem, and when he beheld the body of the lion, and Rakush 
standing beside it, he knew what had been done. Then he opened his mouth in 
reproof, and said-   
<p>"O thoughtless steed, who bade thee combat lions? Wherefore didst thou not 
wake me? for if thou hadst been overcome, who, I pray thee, could have borne my 
weight into Mazandaran, whither I must hie me to deliver the Shah?   
<p>When he had thus spoken he turned again to sleep, but Rakush was sorrowful 
and downcast in his spirit.   
<p>Now when morn was come they set forth once again upon their travels. And all 
day long they passed through a desert, and the pitiless sun burned down upon 
their heads, and the sand was living fire, and the steed and rider were like to 
perish of thirst, and nowhere could Rustem find the traces of water. So he made 
him ready to die, and commended his soul unto God, and prayed Him to remember 
Kai Kaous, His servant, nor abandon him in his distress. Then he laid him down 
to await the end. But lo! when he thought it was come, there passed before him a 
ram, well nourished and fat. And Rustem said unto himself-   
<p>"Surely the watering-place of this beast cannot be distant."   
<p>Then he roused him and led Rakush and followed in the footsteps of the ram, 
and behold, it led him unto a spring of water, cool and clear. And Rustem drank 
thereof with greed, and he gave unto Rakush, and bathed him in the waters, and 
when they were both refreshed he sought for the traces of the ram. And they were 
nowhere to be found. Then Rustem knew that Ormuzd had wrought a wonder for his 
sake, and he fell upon the ground and lifted up his soul in thankfulness. Then 
when he had caught and eaten a wild ass, he laid him down to slumber. And he 
spake and said unto Rakush-   
<p>"I charge thee, O my steed, that thou seek no strife during my slumbers. If 
an enemy cometh before thee, come unto me and neigh beside mine ear, and verily 
I will waken and come to thine aid."   
<p>And Rakush listened, and when he saw that Rustem slumbered, he gambolled and 
grazed beside him. But when some watches of the night were spent, there came 
forth an angry dragon whose home was in this spot, a dragon fierce and fiery, 
whom even the Devs dared not encounter. And when he beheld Rakush and Rustem he 
was astonished that a man should slumber softly beside his lair. And he came 
towards them with his breath of poison. Then Rakush, when he saw it, stamped his 
hoofs upon the ground and beat the air with his tail, so that the noise thereof 
resounded wide, and Rustem was awakened with the din. And he was angry with 
Rakush that he had wakened him, for the dragon had vanished, and he could see no 
cause for fear. And he said-   
<p>"It is thy fault, O unkind steed, that slumber is fled from me."   
<p>Then he turned him to sleep once again. But when the dragon saw it he came 
forth once more, and once more did Rakush wake Rustem, and once more did the 
dragon vanish ere the eyes of Rustem were opened. And when Rakush had thus 
awakened the hero yet three times, Rustem was beside him with anger, and wisdom 
departed from its dwelling. He piled reproaches upon the horse, and hurled 
bitter words upon his head, and he sware that if he acted thus again he would 
slay him with his arm of power, and would wander on foot unto Mazandaran. And he 
said-   
<p>"I bade thee call upon me if dangers menaced, but thou sufferest me not to 
slumber when all is well."   
<p>Then Rustem drew his leopard-skin about him and laid him down again to sleep. 
But Rakush was pained in his spirit, and pawed the ground in his vexation. Then 
the dragon came forth yet again, and was about to fall upon Rakush, and the 
steed was sore distressed how he should act. But he took courage and came beside 
Rustem once more, and stamped upon the ground and neighed and woke him. And 
Rustem sprang up in fury, but this time it was given unto him to behold the 
dragon, and he knew that Rakush had done that which was right. And he drew his 
armour about him and unsheathed his sword, and came forth to meet the fiery 
beast. Then the dragon said-   
<p>"What is thy name, and who art thou that dost venture against me? for verily 
the woman that bore thee shall weep."   
<p>And the Pehliva answered, "I am Rustem, of the seed of Zal, and in myself I 
am an host, and none can withstand my might."   
<p>But the dragon laughed at his words, and held them to be vain boasting. Then 
he fell upon Rustem, the son of Zal, and he wound himself about his body, and 
would have crushed him with his writhings, and you would have said that the end 
of this hero was come. But Rakush, when he beheld the straits of his master, 
sprang upon the dragon from the rear, and he tore him as he had torn the lion, 
and Rustem pierced the beast with his sword, and between them the world was 
delivered of this scourge. Then Rustem was glad, and he praised Rakush, and 
washed him at the fountain, and gave thanks to God who had given unto him the 
victory. And when he had so done he sprang into his saddle, and rode until they 
were come unto the land of the magicians.   
<p>Now when evening was fallen over the land they came unto a green and shady 
vale, and a brook ran through it, and cool woods clothed its sides. And beside a 
spring there was spread a table, and wine and all manner of good cheer stood 
thereon. And Rustem, when he saw it, loosened his saddle and bade Rakush graze 
and drink, and he seated him beside the table and enjoyed its fare. And his 
spirit laughed with pleasure that he had found a table ready dressed within the 
desert, for he knew not that it was the table of the magicians, who were fled on 
his approach. And he ate and drank, and when he had stilled his hunger he took 
up a lyre that lay beside him, and he lilted to it in his ease of heart. And he 
sang-   
<p>"Rustem is the scourge of the base, Not for him were pleasures meant; Rare 
are his feasts and holidays, His garden is the desert place, The battlefield his 
tournament.   
<p>"There the sword of Rustem cleaves Not the armour of jousting knights, But 
the skulls of dragons and Devs; Nor shall Rustem, as he believes, Ever be quit 
of the foes he fights.   
<p>"Cups of wine and wreaths of rose, Gardens where cool arbours stand, Fortune 
gave such gifts as those Not to Rustem, but hurtling foes, Strife, and a 
warrior's heart and hand."   
<p>Now the song of Rustem was come to the ears of one of the witches, and she 
changed herself into a damsel with a face of spring. And she came before Rustem 
and asked him his name, and toyed with him, and he was pleased with her company. 
And he poured out wine and handed it unto her, and bade her drink unto Ormuzd. 
But the magician, when she heard the name of God, fell into a tremble and her 
visage changed, and Rustem beheld her in all her vileness. Then his quick spirit 
knew her for what she was, and he made a noose and caught her in his snare, and 
severed her in twain. And all the magicians, when they saw it, were afraid, and 
none durst come forth to meet the hero. But Rustem straightway departed from 
this spot.   
<p>And Rustem rode till that he was come unto a land where the sun never 
shineth, neither stars lighten the blackness, and he could not see his path. So 
he suffered Rakush to lead him at his will. And they stumbled along amid the 
blackness, but at the end they came out again into the light. And Rustem beheld 
a land that was swathed in verdure, and fields wherein the crops were sprouting. 
Then he loosened Rakush and bade him graze, and laid himself down to slumber 
awhile.   
<p>Now Rakush went forth to graze in a field that had been sown, and the 
guardian thereof, when he saw it, was angry, and ran unto the spot where Rustem 
was couched, and beat the soles of his feet with a stick and woke him. And he 
flung reproaches and evil words upon him for that his horse was broken into the 
pastures. Then Rustem was angry, and fell upon the man, and took him by the ears 
and tore them from his body. And the man fled, howling in his agony, and came 
before Aulad, the ruler of the land, and laid his plaints before him. And Aulad 
also was angry, and went forth to seek Rustem, and demand his name and mission, 
and wherefore he had thus disturbed their peace. And Aulad sware that he would 
destroy him for this deed.   
<p>Then Rustem answered, "I am the thunder-cloud that sendeth forth lightnings, 
and none can stand before my strength. But if thou shouldest hear my name, the 
blood would stand still within thy veins. Thou art come against me with an host, 
see therefore how I shall scatter them like the wind."   
<p>And when he had thus spoken, Rustem fell upon the warriors of Aulad, and he 
beat them down before him, and their heads fell under the blows of his sword of 
death. And the army was routed at the hands of one man. Now Aulad, when he saw 
it, wept and fled; but Rustem pursued him, and threw his noose about him, and 
caught him in the snare. And the world became dark unto Aulad. Then Rustem bound 
him, and threw him on the ground, and said-   
<p>"If thou speak unto me that which is true, verily I will release thee; and 
when I shall have overcome the Devs, I will give the land of Mazandaran into 
thy hands. Tell me, therefore, where dwelleth the White Dev, and where may I 
find the Shah and his men, and how can I deliver them from bondage?"   
<p>Then Aulad answered and told Rustem how it was an hundred farsangs unto the 
spot where Kai Kaous groaned in his bondage, and how it was yet another hundred 
unto the mountain pass where dwelt the Dev. And he told him how the passes were 
guarded by lions and magicians and mighty men, and how none had ever pierced 
thereunto. And he counselled him to desist from this quest.   
<p>But Rustem smiled, and said, "Be thou my guide, and thou wilt behold an 
elephant overcome the might of evil."   
<p>And when he had thus spoken he sprang upon Rakush, and Aulad in his bonds ran 
after him, and they sped like the wind, neither did they halt by night or day 
till they were come unto the spot where Kai Kaous had been smitten by the Devs. 
And when they were come there they could behold the watch-fires of Mazandaran. 
Then Rustem laid him down to sleep, and he tied Aulad unto a tree that he should 
not escape him. But when the sun was risen he laid the mace of Saum before his 
saddle, and rode with gladness towards the city of the Devs.   
<p>Now when Rustem was come nigh unto the tents of Arzang, that led the army of 
Mazandaran, he uttered a cry that rent the mountains. And the cry brought forth 
Arzang from out his tent, and when he perceived Rustem he ran at him, and would 
have thrown him down. But Rustem sprang upon Arzang, and he seemed an insect in 
his grasp. And he overcame him, and parted his head from his body, and hung it 
upon his saddlebow in triumph. And fear came upon the army of Mazandaran when 
they saw it, and they fled in faintness of spirit, and so great was the 
confusion that none beheld whither he bent his steps. And fathers fell upon 
sons, and brothers upon brothers, and dismay was spread throughout the land.   
<p>Then Rustem loosened the bonds of Aulad, and bade him lead him into the city 
where Kai Kaous pined in his bondage. And Aulad led him. Now when they neared 
the city, Rakush neighed so loud that the sound pierced even unto the spot where 
Kai Kaous was hidden. And the Shah, when he heard it, rejoiced, for he knew that 
succour was come. And he told it unto his comrades. But they refused to listen 
unto these words, and deemed that grief had distraught his wits. In vain 
therefore did Kai Kaous insist unto them that his ears had heard the voice of 
Rakush. But not long did he combat their unbelief, for presently there came 
before him Tehemten, the stout of limb, and when the nobles heard his voice and 
his step they repented them of their doubts. And Kai Kaous embraced Rustem and 
blessed him, and questioned him of his journey and of Zal. Then he said-   
<p>"O my Pehliva, we may no longer waste the moments with sweet words. I must 
send thee forth yet again to battle. For when the White Dev shall learn that 
Arzang is defeated, he will come forth from out his mountain fastness, and bring 
with him the whole multitude of evil ones, and even thy might will not stand 
before them. Go therefore unto the Seven Mountains, and conquer the White Dev 
ere the tidings reach him of thy coming. Unto thee alone can Iran look for her 
succour, for I cannot aid thee, neither can my warriors assist thee with their 
arms, for our eyes are filled with darkness, and their light is gone out. Yet I 
grieve to send thee into this emprise alone, for I have heard it spoken that the 
dwelling of the Devs is a spot of fear and terror, but alas! my grief is of no 
avail. And I conjure thee, slay the Dev, and bring unto me the blood of his 
heart, for a Mubid hath revealed unto me that only by this blood can our sight 
be restored. And go forth now, my son, and may Ormuzd be gracious unto thee, and 
may the tree of gladness sprout again for Iran!   
<p>Then Rustem did as Kai Kaous commanded, and he rode forth, and Aulad went 
beside him to lead him in the way. And when they had passed the Seven Mountains 
and were come unto the gates of hell, Rustem spake unto Aulad, and said-   
<p>"Thou hast ever led me aright, and all that thou hast spoken I have surely 
found it true. Tell me, therefore, now how I shall vanquish the Devs."   
<p>And Aulad said, "Tarry, I counsel thee, till that the sun be high in the 
heavens. For when it beateth fierce upon the earth the Devs are wont to lay 
them down to slumber, and when they are drunk with sleep they shall fall an easy 
prey into thine hands."   
<p>Then Rustem did as Aulad bade him, and he halted by the roadside, and he 
bound Aulad from head to foot in his snare, and he seated himself upon the ends. 
But when the sun was high he drew forth his sword from out its sheath, and 
shouted loud his name, and flung it among the Devs like to a thunderbolt. Then 
before they were well awakened from their sleep, he threw himself upon them, and 
none could resist him, and he scattered their heads with his sword. And when he 
had dispersed the guards he came unto the lair of the White Dev.   
<p>Then Rustem stepped within the rocky tomb wherein the Dev was hidden, and 
the air was murky and heavy with evil odours, and the Pehliva could not see his 
path. But he went on void of fear, though the spot was fearful and dangers 
lurked in its sides. And when he was come unto the end of the cave he found a 
great mass like to a mountain, and it was the Dev in his midday slumber. Then 
Rustem woke him, and the Dev was astonished at his daring, and sprang at the 
hero, and threw a great stone like a small mountain upon him. And Rustem's heart 
trembled, and he said unto himself, "If I escape to-day, I shall live for ever." 
And he fell on the Dev, and they struggled hot and sore, and the Dev tore 
Rustem, but Rustem defended himself, and they wrestled with force till that the 
blood and sweat ran down in rivers from their bodies. Then Rustem prayed to God, 
and God heard him and gave him strength, and in the end Rustem overcame the 
White Dev and slew him. And he severed his head from his trunk, and cut his 
heart from out his midst.   
<p>Then Rustem returned him unto Aulad and told him what he had done. And Aulad 
said-   
<p>"O brave lion, who hast vanquished the world with thy sword, release now, I 
pray thee, this thy servant, for thy snare is entered into my flesh. And suffer 
that I recall to thee how that thou hast promised to me a recompense, and surely 
thou wilt fulfil thy word."   
<p>And Rustem answered and said, "Ay, verily; but I have yet much to do ere that 
my mission be ended. For I have still to conquer the King of Mazandaran; but 
when these things shall be accomplished, in truth I will fulfil my words unto 
thee."   
<p>Then he bade Aulad follow him, and they retraced their steps until they were 
come unto the spot where Kai Kaous was held in bondage. And when Kai Kaous 
learned that Rustem was returned with victory upon his brow he shouted for joy, 
and all the host shouted with him, and they could not contain themselves for 
happiness. And they called down the blessings of Heaven upon the head of Rustem. 
But when the hero came before them, he took of the blood of the White Dev and 
poured it into their eyes, and the eyes of Kai Kaous and his men were opened, 
and they once again beheld the glory of the day. Then they swept the ground 
around them with fire, with swords they overcame their gaolers. But when they 
had finished, Kai Kaous bade them desist from further bloodshed.   
<p>Then Kai Kaous wrote a letter unto the King of Mazandaran, and he counselled 
him that he should conclude a peace. And he related to him how that his mainstay 
was broken, for Rustem had overcome Arzang and slain the White Dev. And he said 
that Rustem would slay him also if he should not submit unto Iran and pay 
tribute to its Shah. Then Kai Kaous sent a messenger with this writing unto the 
King of Mazandaran.   
<p>Now the King, when he had read the letter, and learned how that Arzang and 
the White Dev and all his train were slain, was sore troubled, and he paled in 
his spirit, and it seemed to him that the sun of his glory was about to set. 
Howbeit he suffered not the messenger to behold his distress, but wrote haughty 
words unto Kai Kaous, and dared him to come forth to meet him. And he boasted of 
his might and reproached Kai Kaous with his folly. And he threatened that he 
would raze Iran unto the dust.   
<p>When Kai Kaous had read this answer he was wroth, and his nobles with him. 
And Rustem spake and said-   
<p>"Permit me, O my Shah, that I go forth before the King of Mazandaran, and 
intrust unto me yet another writing."   
<p>Then Kai Kaous sent for a scribe, and the scribe cut a reed like to the point 
of an arrow, and he wrote with it the words that Kai Kaous dictated. And Kai 
Kaous made not many words. He bade the King lay aside his arrogance, and he 
warned him of the fate that would await his disobedience, and he said unto him 
that if he listened not he might hang his severed head on the walls of his own 
city. Then he signed the letter with his royal seal, and Rustem bore it forth 
from the camp.   
<p>Now when the King of Mazandaran learned that Kai Kaous sent him yet another 
messenger, he bade the flower of his army go forth to meet him. And Rustem, when 
he saw them come near, laid hold upon a tree of great stature and spreading 
branches that grew by the wayside. And he uprooted the tree from the earth, and 
brandished it in his hands like to a javelin. And those that saw it were amazed 
at his strength. Then Rustem, when he beheld their awe, flung the tree among 
them, and many a brave man was dismounted by this mace. Then there stepped forth 
from the midst of the host one of the giants of Mazandaran, and he begged that 
he might grasp Rustem by the hand. And when he had hold of the hand of the 
Pehliva he pressed it with all his might, for he thought that he could wring off 
this hand of valour. But Rustem smiled at the feebleness of his grasp, and he 
grasped him in return, and the giant grew pale, and the veins started forth upon 
his hands.   
<p>Then one set off to tell the King what he had seen. And the King sent forth 
his doughtiest knight, and bade him retrieve the honour of their strength. And 
Kalahour the knight said-   
<p>"Verily so will I do, and I will force the tears of pain from the eyes of 
this messenger."   
<p>And he came towards Rustem and wrung his hand, and his gripe was like to a 
vise, and Rustem felt the pang thereof, and he winced in his suffering. But he 
would not let the men of Mazandaran glory in his triumph. He took the hand of 
Kalahour in his own, and grasped it and crushed it till that the blood issued 
from its veins and the nails fell from off its fingers. Then Kalahour turned him 
and went before the Shah and showed unto him his hand. And he counselled him to 
make peace with the land that could send forth such messengers whose might none 
could withstand. But the King was loath to sue for peace, and he commanded that 
the messenger be brought before him.   
<p>Then the elephant-bodied stood before the King of Mazandaran. And the King 
questioned him of his journey, and of Kai Kaous, and of the road that he was 
come. And while he questioned he took muster of him with his eyes, and when he 
had done speaking he cried-   
<p>"Surely thou art Rustem, for thou hast the arms and breast of a Pehliva."   
<p>But Rustem replied, "Not so, I am but a slave who is not held worthy to serve 
even in his train; for he is a Pehliva great and strong, whose like the earth 
hath not seen." Then he handed unto the King the writing of his master. But when 
the King had read it he was wild with anger, and he said to Rustem-   
<p>"Surely he that hath sent thee is mad that he addresseth such words unto me. 
For if he be master in Iran, I am lord of Mazandaran, and never shall he call me 
his vassal. And verily it was his own overweening that let him fall between my 
hands, yet hath he learned no lesson from his disasters, but deemeth he can 
crush me with haughty words. Go, say unto him that the King of Mazandaran will 
meet him in battle, and verily his pride shall learn to know humility."   
<p>And when the King had thus spoken he dismissed Rustem from his presence, but 
he would have had him bear forth rich gifts. But Rustem would not take them, for 
he too was angered, and he spurred him unto Kai Kaous with a heart hungry for 
vengeance.   
<p>And Kai Kaous made ready his army, and the King of Mazandaran did likewise. 
And they marched forth unto the meeting-place, and the earth groaned under the 
feet of the war-elephants. And for seven days did the battle rage fast and 
furious, and all the earth was darkened with the black dust; and the fire of 
swords and maces flashed through the blackness like to lightning from a 
thundercloud. And the screams of the Devs, and the shouts of the warriors, and 
the clanging of the trumpets, and the beating of drums, and the neighing of 
horses, and the groans of the dying made the earth hideous with noise. And the 
blood of the brave turned the plain into a lake, and it was a combat such as 
none hath seen the like. But victory leaned to neither side. Then on the eighth 
day Kai Kaous took from his head the crown of the Kaianides and bowed him in the 
dust before Ormuzd. And he prayed and said-   
<p>"O Lord of earth, incline thine ear unto my voice, and grant that I may 
overcome these Devs who rest not their faith in Thee. And I pray Thee do this 
not for my sake, who am unworthy of Thy benefits, but for the sake of Iran, Thy 
kingdom."   
<p>Then he put the crown once more upon his head, and went out again before the 
army.   
<p>And all that day the hosts fought like lions, and pity and mercy were 
vanished from the world, and heaven itself seemed to rain maces. But Ormuzd had 
heard the prayer of His servant, and when evening was come the army of 
Mazandaran was faded like a flower. Then Rustem, perceiving the King of 
Mazandaran, challenged him to single combat. And the King consented, and Rustem 
overcame him, and raised his lance to strike him, saying-   
<p>"Perish, O evil Dev! for thy name is struck out of the lists of those who 
carry high their heads."   
<p>But when he was about to strike him, the King put forth his arts of magic, 
and he was changed into a rock within sight of all the army. And Rustem was 
confounded thereat, and he knew not what he should do. But Kai Kaous commanded 
that the rock should be brought before his throne. So those among the army who 
were strong of limb meshed it with cords and tried to raise it from the earth. 
But the rock resisted all their efforts and none could move it a jot. Then 
Rustem, the elephant-limbed, came forward to test his power, and he grasped the 
rock in his mighty fist, and he bore it in his hands across the hills, even unto 
the spot that Kai Kaous had named, and all the army shouted with amazement when 
they saw it.   
<p>Now when Rustem had laid down the stone at the feet of the Shah, he spake and 
said unto it-   
<p>"Issue forth, I command thee, O King of Mazandaran, or I will break thee into 
atoms with my mace."   
<p>When the King heard this threat he was afraid, and came out of the stone, and 
stood before Rustem in all his vileness. And Rustem took his hand and smiled and 
led him before Kai Kaous, and said-   
<p>"I bring thee this piece of rock, whom fear of my blows hath brought into 
subjection."   
<p>Then Kai Kaous reproached the King with all the evil he had done him, and 
when he had spoken he bade that the head of this wicked man should be severed 
from its trunk. And it was done as Kai Kaous commanded. Then Kai Kaous gave 
thanks unto God, and distributed rich gifts unto his army, to each man according 
to his deserts. And he prepared a feast, and bade them rejoice and make merry 
with wine. And at last he called before him Rustem, his Pehliva, and gave to him 
thanks, and said that but for his aid he would not have sat again upon his 
throne. But Rustem said-   
<p>"Not so, O King, thy thanks are due unto Aulad, for he it was who led me 
aright, and instructed me how I could vanquish the Devs. Grant, therefore, now 
that I may fulfil my promise unto him, and bestow on him the crown of 
Mazandaran."   
<p>When Kai Kaous heard these words he did as Rustem desired, and Aulad received 
the crown and the land, and there was peace yet again in Iran. And the land 
rejoiced thereat, and Kai Kaous opened the doors of his treasures, and all was 
well within his borders. Then Rustem came before the Shah and prayed that he 
might be permitted to return unto his father. And Kai Kaous listened to the just 
desires of his Pehliva, and he sent him forth laden with rich gifts, and he 
could not cease from pouring treasure before him. And he blessed him, and 
said-   
<p>"Mayst thou live as long as the sun and moon, and may thy heart continue 
steadfast, mayst thou ever be the joy of Iran!"   
<p>Then when Rustem was departed, Kai Kaous gave himself up unto delights and to 
wine, but he governed his land right gloriously. He struck the neck of care with 
the sword of justice, he caused the earth to be clad with verdure, and God 
granted unto him His countenance, and the hand of Ahriman could do no hurt.   
<p>
Thus endeth the history of the march into Mazandaran.
