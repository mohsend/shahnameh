Anon it came about that Zal desired to see the kingdom. And he set forth, and 
there followed after him a goodly train, and when they had journeyed a while 
they marched with pomp into Cabul. Now Mihrab, who was descended from Zohak the 
Serpent, reigned in Cabul, yet he was worthy, prudent, and wise. When he heard 
that the son of Saum, to whom he paid tribute, drew nigh unto the city, he went 
out to meet him, and his nobles went with him, and slaves bearing costly gifts. 
And Zal, hearing that Mihrab was at hand, prepared a feast in his tents, and 
Mihrab and his train feasted with him until the night was far spent. Now, after 
the King was gone, Zal praised his beauty. Then a noble rose up and said unto 
him-   
<p>"O Zal, thou knowest not beauty since thou hast not beheld the daughter of 
this man. For she is like unto the slender cypress, her face is brighter than 
the sun, her mouth is a pomegranate flower."   
<p>When Zal heard these words he was filled with longing, and sleep would not 
visit his eyelids for thinking of her beauty.   
<p>Now, when the day dawned, he opened the doors of his court, and the nobles 
stood about him, each man according to his rank. And presently there came from 
Cabul Mihrab the King to tender morning greeting to the stranger without his 
gates. And Zal desired that Mihrab should crave a boon at his hands. Then spake 
Mihrab unto him saying-   
<p>"O ruler mighty and great, I have but one desire, and to bring it to pass is 
easy. For I crave thee that thou dwell as guest beneath my roof, and let my 
heart rejoice in thy presence."   
<p>Then Zal said unto him, "O King, ask not this boon at my hands, I pray thee, 
for it can in nowise be accomplished. The Shah and Saum would be angered should 
they learn that I had eaten under the roof of Zohak. I beg of thee ask aught but 
this."   
<p>When Mihrab heard these words he was sorrowful, and bent low before Zal, and 
departed from out the tents. And the eye of Zal looked after him, and yet again 
he spake his praises. Then he bethought him of the King's daughter, and how that 
she was fair, and he was sunk in brooding and desire, and the days passed 
unheeded over his head.   
<p>Now it came to pass that on a certain morning Mihrab stepped forth from his 
palace to the house of the women to visit Sindokht his wife, and her daughter 
Rudabeh. Truly the house was like to a garden for colour and perfume, and over 
all shone those moons of beauty. Now when Mihrab had greeted Rudabeh he 
marvelled at her loveliness, and called down the blessings of Heaven upon her 
head. Then Sindokht opened her lips and questioned Mihrab concerning the 
stranger whose tents were without their gates. And she said-   
<p>"I pray thee tell unto me what manner of man is this white-haired son of 
Saum, and is he worthy the nest or the throne? "   
<p>Then Mihrab said unto her, "O my fair cypress, the son of Saum is a hero 
among men. His heart is like unto a lion's, his strength is as an elephant's, to 
his friends he is a gracious Nile, unto his enemies a wasting crocodile. And in 
him are even blemishes turned to beauties, his white locks but enhance his 
glory."   
<p>When Rudabeh had listened to these words her heart burned with love for Zal, 
so that she could neither eat nor rest, and was like unto one that hath changed 
her shape. And after a while, because that she could bear the burden thereof no 
longer, she told her secret to the slaves that loved and served her. And she 
charged them tell no man, and entreated of them that they would aid her to allay 
the troubles of her heart. And when the slaves had listened to her story, they 
were filled with fear, and with one accord entreated her that she would dismiss 
from her heart one branded among men, and whom his own father had cast out. But 
Rudabeh would not listen to their voice. And when they beheld that she was firm 
in her spirit, and that their words were vain, they cast about how they might 
serve her. And one among them who was wise above the rest opened her lips and 
spake-   
<p>"O moon-faced beauty, slender cypress, it shall be done at thy desire. Thy 
slaves will neither rest nor slumber until the royal youth shall have become the 
footstool to thy feet."   
<p>Then Rudabeh was glad and said- "An the issue be happy, there shall be 
planted for thee a noble tree, and it shall bear riches and jewels, and wisdom 
shall cull its fruits."   
<p>Then the slaves pondered in their hearts how they should compass their end, 
for they knew that only by craft could it be brought about. Straightway they 
clothed themselves in costly raiment, and went forth blithely into the garden of 
flowers that was spread beside the river's bank without the city. And they 
gathered roses, and decked their hair with blossoms, and threw them into the 
stream for sooth-telling; and as they gathered they came unto the spot over 
against which were pitched the tents of Zal. Now Zal beheld them from his tent, 
and he questioned them concerning these rose-gatherers. And one uprose and said 
unto him-   
<p>"They are slaves sent forth by the moon of Cabul into the garden of 
flowers."   
<p>Now when Zal heard this his heart leaped for joy, and he set forth unto the 
river's bank with only one page to bear him company. And seeing a water-bird fly 
upwards, he took his bow and shot it through the heart, and it fell among the 
rose-gatherers. Then Zal bade the boy cross the water and bring him the bird. 
And when he had landed, the moon-faced women pressed about him and questioned 
him, saying-   
<p>"O youth, tell us the name of him who aimeth thus surely, for verily he is a 
king among men."   
<p>Then the boy answering said, "What! know ye not the son of Saum the hero? The 
world hath not his equal for strength and beauty."   
<p>But the girls reproved him, and said, "Not so, boast not thus vainly, for the 
house of Mihrab holdeth a sun that o'ershines all besides."   
<p>And the page smiled, and the smile yet lingered on his lips when he came back 
to Zal. And Zal said-   
<p>"Why smilest thou, boy? What have they spoken unto thee that thou openest thy 
lips and showest thy ivory teeth? "   
<p>Then the boy told unto him the speech of the women. And Zal said-   
<p>"Go over yet again and bid them tarry, that they may bear back jewels with 
their roses."   
<p>And he chose forth from among his treasures trinkets of pearl and gold, and 
sent them to the slaves. Then the one who had sworn to serve Rudabeh above the 
rest craved that she might look upon the face of the hero, for she said-   
<p>"A secret that is known to three is one no longer." And Zal granted her 
desire, and she told him of Rudabeh and of her beauty, and his passion burned 
the more. And he spake-   
<p>"Show unto me, I pray thee, the path by which I may behold this fair one, for 
my heart is filled with longing."   
<p>Then the slave said, "Suffer that we go back to the house of the women, and 
we will fill the ears of Rudabeh with praises of the son of Saum, and will 
entangle her in the meshes of our net, and the lion shall rejoice in his chase 
of the lamb."   
<p>Then Zal bade her go forth, and the women returned to the house rejoicing and 
saying-   
<p>"The lion entereth the snare spread forth to entrap him, and the wishes of 
Rudabeh and Zal will be accomplished."   
<p>But when they were come to the gates the porter chid them that they were gone 
without while the stranger sojourned in Cabul, and they were troubled and sore 
afraid for their secret. But they stilled his wrath and came unto where Rudabeh 
awaited them. And they told her of Zal, the son of Saum, and of his beauty and 
his prowess. And Rudabeh smiled and said-   
<p>"Wherefore have ye thus changed your note? For a while back ye spake with 
scorn of this bird-reared youth, on whose head hang the locks of a sage, but now 
are ye loud in his praises."   
<p>Then Rudabeh began privily to deck her house that it might be worthy a guest. 
With brocades of Roum and carpets of Ind did she hang it, and she perfumed it 
with musk and ambergris, and flowers did she cause to bloom about the rooms. And 
when the sun was sunk, and the doors of the house were locked and the keys 
withdrawn, a slave went forth unto Zal, the son of Saum. And she spake unto him 
in a low voice-   
<p>"Come now, for all is ready." And Zal followed after her. And when they were 
come to the house of the women Zal beheld the daughter of the King standing upon 
the roof, and her beauty was like unto a cypress on which the full moon shineth. 
And when she beheld him, she spake and said-   
<p>"I bid thee welcome, O young man, son of a hero, and may the blessing of 
Heaven rest upon thee."   
<p>And Zal answered her benison, and prayed that he might enter into nearer 
converse, for he was on the ground and she was on the roof. Then the Peri-faced 
loosened her tresses, and they were long, so that they fell from the battlements 
unto the ground. And she said unto Zal-   
<p>"Here hast thou a cord without flaw. Mount, O Pehliva, and seize my black 
locks, for it is fitting that I should be a snare unto thee."   
<p>But Zal cried, "Not so, O fair one, it would beseem me ill to do thee 
hurt."

<p>And he covered her hair with kisses. Then he called for a cord and made a 
running knot, and threw it upwards and fastened it to the battlements. And with 
a bound he swung himself upon the roof. Then Rudabeh took his hand and they 
stepped down together into the golden chambers, and the slaves stood round about 
them. And they gazed upon each other and knew that they excelled in beauty, and 
the hours slipped by in sweet talk, while love was fanned in their hearts. Then 
Zal cried-   
<p>"O fair cypress, musk-perfumed, when Minuchihr shall learn of this he will be 
angered and Saum also will chide. And they will say I have forgotten my God, and 
will lift their hands against me. But I swear unto thee that this life is to me 
vile if it be not spent in thy presence. And I call upon Heaven to hear me that 
none other but thee will I call my bride."   
<p>And Rudabeh said, "I too will swear unto thee this oath."   
<p>So the hours sped, and there arose from out the tents of the King the sound 
of drums that announce the coming of the day. Then cried Zal and Rudabeh of one 
accord-   
<p>"O glory of the world, tarry yet a while, neither arrive so quickly."   
<p>But the sun gave no ear to their reproaches, and the hour to part was come. 
Then Zal swung himself from the battlements unto the ground, and quitted the 
house of his beloved.   
<p>Now when the earth was flooded with light, and the nobles and chiefs had 
tendered unto Zal their morning greetings as was their wont, he called about him 
his Mubids, and laid before them how that he was filled with love for a daughter 
of the Serpent. And the Mubids when they heard it were troubled, and their lips 
were closed, and the words were chained upon their tongues. For there was none 
of them that listed to mingle poison in the honey of this love. Whereupon Zal 
reproved them, and said that he would bestow on them rich gifts if they would 
open their mouths. Then they spake and said unto him that the honour of a king 
could not suffer by a woman, and though Mihrab be indeed of Zohak's race, he was 
noble and valiant. And they urged him to write unto his father and crave Saum to 
wait upon the Shah.   
<p>Then Zal called unto him a scribe and bade him write down the words that he 
spake. And he told unto Saum his love and his fears. And he recalled unto him 
how that he had cast him out, and how that he had lived in a nest, and a bird 
had reared him, and the sun had poured down upon his head, and raw flesh had 
been his nourishment the while his father had sat within a goodly house clothed 
in silk. And he recalled the promise given to him by Saum. Neither did he seek 
to justify that which was come about. Then he gave the letter to a messenger, 
and bade him ride until he should be come into the presence of Saum.   
<p>When Saum had heard the words of his son his spirit was troubled, and he 
cried-   
<p>"Woe unto me, for now is clear what hath so long been hidden. One whom a wild 
bird hath reared looketh for the fulfilment of wild desires, and seeks union 
with an accursed race."   
<p>And he pondered long what he should answer. For he said, "If I say, Abandon 
this desire, sow no discord, return to reason, I break my oath and God will 
punish me. Yet if I say, Thy desire is just, satisfy the passions of thy heart, 
what offspring can come to pass from the union of a Dev and the nursling of a 
bird?"   
<p>And the heart of Saum was heavy with care. So he called unto him his Mubids 
that they should search the stars, for he said-   
<p>"If I mingle fire and water I do ill, and ill will come of it."   
<p>Then all that day the Wise Men searched the secrets of Fate, and they cast 
the horoscope of Zal and Rudabeh, and at even they returned to the King 
rejoicing. And they found him torn with anguish. Then they said-   
<p>"Hail unto thee, O Saum, for we have followed the movement of the stars and 
counted their course, and we have read the message of the skies. And it is 
written, 'A clear spring shall issue into the day, a son shall be born to Zal, a 
hero full of power and glory, and there shall not be his like in Iran.' "   
<p>Now when Saum had drunk in these words, his soul was uplifted, and he poured 
gifts upon the Mubids. Then he called to him the messenger of Zal, and he gave 
him pieces of silver, and bade him return unto his master and say-   
<p>"I hold thy passion folly, O my son, but because of the oath that I have 
sworn to thee it shall be done at thy desire. I will hie me unto Iran and lay 
thy suit before the Shah."   
<p>Then Saum called together his army and set forth for Iran, and the sound of 
trumpets and cymbals went before him.   
<p>Now when the messenger was come back to Zal, he rejoiced and praised God, and 
gave gold and silver to the poor, and gifts unto his servants. But when night 
was come he could not close his eyes in slumber, nor could he rest during the 
day. Neither did he drink wine nor demand the singers, for his soul was filled 
with longing after his love. And presently there came out to him a slave, and he 
gave unto her Saum's letter that she might bear it to Rudabeh. And Rudabeh 
rejoiced also, and chose from among her treasures a costly crown and a ring of 
worth, and bade the woman bear them unto Zal. Now as she quitted the chamber she 
met Sindokht. And the Queen questioned her and said-   
<p>"Whence comest thou? Reply to all my questions, neither seek thou to deceive 
me, for already a long time do I suspect thy passing to and fro."   
<p>And the woman trembled as she heard these words, and fell down and kissed the 
feet of the Queen, and said-   
<p>"Have pity on thine handmaiden, who is poor and gaineth her bread as she can. 
I go into the houses of the rich and sell to them robes and jewels. And Rudabeh 
hath this day bought of me a tiara and a bracelet of gold."   
<p>Then said Sindokht, "Show unto me the money thou hast received for the same, 
that my anger be appeased."   
<p>And the woman answered and said, "Demand not that I show unto thee that which 
I have not, for Rudabeh will pay me to-morrow."   
<p>Now Sindokht knew that these words were feigned, and she searched the sleeve 
of the woman, and lo! she found therein the tiara that Rudabeh had broidered 
with her hands. Then she was angered, and commanded that the slave should be 
bound in chains. And she desired that her daughter be brought into her presence. 
And when she was come, Sindokht opened her mouth and spake, saying-   
<p>"O moon of noble race, to whom hath been taught naught but that which is 
good, how hast thou gone astray upon the paths of evil? O my daughter, confide 
unto thy mother thy secrets. From whom cometh this woman? For what man are 
destined thy gifts?"   
<p>When she had heard, Rudabeh was abashed, but after a while she told all unto 
Sindokht. Now when the Queen had heard she was confounded, for she feared the 
wrath of the Shah, and that he would raze Cabul to the dust for this mischance. 
And she went into her rooms and wept in her sorrow. Then presently Mihrab the 
King came in to Sindokht, and he was of joyful mind, for Zal had received him 
graciously. But when he beheld her tears he questioned of her grief. Then she 
told him how that his daughter was filled with love for Zal, the son of Saum. 
And when Mihrab had heard her to an end, his heart also was troubled, for he 
knew that Cabul could not stand before the Shah.   
<p>Minuchihr, too, when he had heard these things, was troubled, for he beheld 
in them the device of Ahriman, and feared lest this union should bring evil upon 
Iran. And he bade Nauder call Saum before him. Now when Saum heard the desire of 
the Shah, he spake and said-   
<p>"I obey, and the sight of the King will be a banquet. unto my soul."   
<p>Then Saum went into the presence of Minuchihr, and he kissed the ground, and 
called down blessings upon the head of the Shah. But Minuchihr raised him and 
seated him beside him on the throne, and straightway began to question him 
concerning the war, and the Devs of Mazandaran. Then Saum told him all the 
story of his battles. And Minuchihr listened with joy though the tale was long, 
and when Saum had ended he praised his prowess. And he lifted his crown unto 
heaven and rejoiced that his enemies were thus confounded. Then be bade a 
banquet be spread, and all night long the heroes feasted and shortened the hours 
with wine. But when the first rays of morn had shed their light, the curtains of 
the Shah's house were opened, that he might hold audience and grant the 
petitions of his people. And Saum the Pehliva came the first to stand before the 
King, for he desired to speak to him of Zal. But the Shah of the world would not 
suffer him to open his lips, but said unto him-   
<p>"Go hence, O Saum, and take with thee thine army, for I command thee to go 
yet again to battle. Set forth unto Cabul and burn the house of Mihrab the King, 
and utterly destroy his race and all who serve him, nor suffer that any of the 
seed of Zohak escape destruction, for I will that the earth be delivered of this 
serpent brood."   
<p>When Saum heard these words he knew that the Shah was angered, and that 
speech would avail him naught. So he kissed the throne and touched the earth 
with his forehead, and said, "Lord, I am thy servant, and I obey thy desires." 
And he departed, and the earth trembled under the stamping of footmen and of 
hoofs, and the air of the city was darkened with his spears.   
<p>Now the news of Saum's intent reached even unto Cabul, and the land was sunk 
in woe, and weeping filled the house of the King. But Zal was wroth, and he went 
forth to meet his father. And when he was come to the spot where he had encamped 
his army, he craved an audience. And Saum granted it, and Zal reminded him yet 
again of his oath, and desired that he would spare the land of Cabul, nor visit 
his judgments upon the innocent. When Saum had listened, his heart was moved, 
and he said-   
<p>"O my son, thou speakest that which is right. To thee have I been unjust from 
the day of thy birth. But stay thy wrath, for surely I will find a remedy, and 
thy wishes shall yet be accomplished. For thou shalt bear a letter unto the 
Shah, and when he shall have looked on thy face, he will be moved with 
compassion and cease to trouble thee."   
<p>Then Zal kissed the ground before his father and craved the blessings of God 
upon his head. And Saum dictated a letter to the Shah, and he spoke therein of 
all he had done for Minuchihr, and how he had killed the dragon that had laid 
waste the land, how he had ever subdued the foes of Iran, and how the frontiers 
were enlarged by his hands. Yet now was he waxing old, and could no longer do 
doughty deeds. But a brave son was his, worthy and true, who would follow in his 
footsteps. Only his heart was devoured of love, and perchance he would die if 
his longing were unsatisfied. And therewith he commended to the wisdom of the 
Shah the affairs of Zal.   
<p>When the letter was ended Zal set forth with it unto the court, and the 
flower of his army went with him.   
<p>But the fear of Minuchihr was great in Cabul, and Mihrab pondered how he 
should quench the wrath of the King of kings. And he spake to Sindokht and 
said-   
<p>"For that the King is angered against me because of thee and thy daughter, 
and because I cannot stand before him, I will lead Rudabeh unto his court and 
kill her before his eyes. Perchance his anger may be thus allayed."   
<p>Sindokht listened to his words in silence, and when he had ended she cast 
about her for a plan, for she was quick of wit. And when she had found one she 
came again into the presence of Mihrab, and she craved of him that he should 
give her the key of his treasury. For she said-   
<p>"This is not the hour to be strait-handed; suffer that I take what seemeth 
good unto me and go before Saum, it may be that I move him to spare the 
land."   
<p>And Mihrab agreed to her demand because of the fear that devoured him. Then 
Sindokht went out to the house of Saum, and she took with her three hundred 
thousand pieces of gold, and sixty horses caparisoned in silver, bearing sixty 
slaves that held cups filled to the brim with musk and camphor, and rubies, and 
turquoise, and precious stones of every kind. And there followed two hundred 
dromedaries and four tall Indian elephants laden with carpets and brocades of 
Roum, and the train reached for two miles beyond the King's gates. Now when 
Sindokht was come to Seistan she bade the guardians of the door say unto Saum 
that an envoy was come from Cabul bearing a message. And Saum granted an 
audience, and Sindokht was brought into his presence. Then she kissed the ground 
at his feet and called upon Heaven to shower down blessings on his head. And 
when she had done so, she caused her gifts to be laid before Saum, and when Saum 
beheld these treasures, he marvelled and thought within himself, "How cometh it 
that a woman is sent as envoy from a land that boasteth such riches? If I accept 
them the Shah will be angered, and if I refuse perchance Zal will reproach me 
that I rob him of his heritage." So he lifted his head and said-   
<p>"Let these treasures be given unto the treasurer of my son."   
<p>When Sindokht beheld that her gifts were accepted, she rejoiced and raised 
her voice in speech. And she questioned Saum, saying-   
<p>"Tell me, I pray thee, what wrong have the people of Cabul done unto thee 
that thou wouldst destroy them?"   
<p>Then answered Saum the hero, "Reply unto my questions and lie not. Art thou 
the slave or the wife of Mihrab, and is it thy daughter whom Zal hath seen? If 
indeed it be so, tell me, I pray, of her beauty, that I may know if she be 
worthy of my son."   
<p>Then Sindokht said, "O Pehliva, swear to me first a great oath that thou wilt 
spare my life and the lives of those dear unto me. And when I am assured of thy 
protection I will recount all that thou desirest."   
<p>Then Saum took the hand of Sindokht, and he sware unto her a great oath, and 
gave her his word and his promise. And when she had heard it she was no longer 
afraid, and she told him all her secrets. And she said-   
<p>"I am of the race of Zohak, and wife unto the valiant Mihrab, and mother of 
Rudabeh, who hath found favour in the eyes of thy son. And I am come to learn of 
thy desire, and who are thine enemies in Cabul. Destroy the wicked, and those 
who merit chastisement, but spare, I pray thee, the innocent, or thy deeds will 
change day into night."   
<p>Then spake Saum, "My oath is sacred, and if it cost my life, thou and thine 
and Cabul may rest assured that I will not harm them. And I desire that Zal 
should find a wife in Rudabeh, though she be of an alien race."   
<p>And he told her how that he had written to the Shah a letter of supplication 
such as only one in grief could pen, and how Zal was absent with the message, 
and he craved her to tell him of Rudabeh.   
<p>But Sindokht replied, "If the Pehliva of the world will make the hearts of 
his slaves rejoice, he will visit us and look with his own eyes upon our 
moon."   
<p>And Saum smiled and said, "Rest content and deliver thine heart of cares, for 
all shall end according unto thy desires."   
<p>When Sindokht heard this she bade him farewell and made all haste to return. 
And Saum loaded her with gifts and bade her depart in peace. And Sindokht's face 
shone brightly, like unto the moon when she hath been eclipsed, and hope once 
more reigned in her breast.   
<p>Now listen to what happened to Zal while these things were passing in 
Seistan. When he was come to the court of Minuchihr he hastened into his 
presence, and kissed the ground at his feet, and lay prostrate before him in the 
dust. And when the Shah saw this he was moved, and bade his servants raise Zal, 
and pour musk before him. Then Zal drew nigh unto the throne and gave to the 
King the letter written by Saum the son of Neriman. And when Minuchihr had read 
it he was grieved, and said-   
<p>"This letter, written by Saum thy father in his sorrow, hath awakened an old 
pain within me. But for the sake of my faithful servant I will do unto thee that 
which is thy desire. Yet I ask that thou abide with me a little while that I may 
seek counsel about thee."   
<p>Then the cooks brought forth a table of gold, and Zal was seated beside the 
Shah and all the nobles according to their rank, and they ate flesh and drank 
wine together. Then when the mantle of night was fallen over the earth Zal 
sprang upon his steed and scoured the land in the unrest of his spirit, for his 
heart was full of thoughts and his mouth of words. But when morning was come he 
presented himself before the Shah in audience. And his speech and mien found 
favour in the eyes of the Shah, and he called unto him his Wise Men and bade 
them question the stars of this matter. Three days and three nights did the 
Mubids search the heavens without ceasing, and on the fourth they came before 
the Shah and spake. And they said unto him-   
<p>"Hail to thee, hero of the golden girdle, for we bring unto thee glad 
tidings. The son of Saum and the daughter of Mihrab shall be a glorious pair, 
and from their union shall spring a son like to a war-elephant, and he shall 
subdue all men by his sword and raise the glory of Iran even unto the skies. And 
he shall uproot the wicked from the earth so that there shall be no room for 
them. Segsars and Mazandaran shall feel the weight of his mace, and he shall 
bring much woe upon Turan, but Iran shall be loaded with prosperity at his 
hands. And he will give back sleep to the unhappy, and close the doors of 
discord, and bar the paths of wrong-doing. The kingdom will rejoice while he 
lives; Roum, Ind, and Iran will grave his name upon their seals."   
<p>When the Shah had heard this he charged the Mubids that they keep secret that 
which they had revealed unto him. And he called for Zal that he might question 
him and test his wisdom. And the Wise Men and the Mubids were seated in a 
circle, and they put these questions to the son of Saum.   
<p>And the first opened his mouth and said-   
<p>"Twelve trees, well grown and green, Fair and lofty, have I seen; Each has 
sprung with vigorous sprout, Sending thirty branches out; Wax no more, nor wane, 
they can In the kingdom of Iran."   
<p>And Zal pondered a while and then answered and said-   
<p>'Twelve moons in the year, and each I praise As a new-made king on a new 
throne's blaze: Each comes to an end in thirty days."   
<p>Then the second Mubid questioned him and said-   
<p>"Thou whose head is high in air, Rede me now of coursers twain; Both are 
noble, swift to speed; Black as storms in the night one steed, The other 
crystal, white and fair, They race for ever and haste in vain, Towards a goal 
they never gain."   
<p>And Zal thought again yet a while and answered-   
<p>"Two shining horses, one black, one white. That run for ever in rapid flight; 
The one is the day, the other the night, That count the throbs of the heavens 
height, Like the hunted prey from the following chase They flee, yet neither 
wins the race."   
<p>Then the third Mubid questioned him and said-   
<p>"Thirty knights before the king Pass along. Regard the thing Closely; one is 
gone. Again Look- the thirty are in train."   
<p>And Zal answered and spake-   
<p>"Thirty knights of whom the train Is full, then fails, then fills again, 
Know, each moon is reckoned thus, So willed by God who governs us, And thy word 
is true of the faint moon's wane, Now failing in darkness, now shining 
plain."   
<p>Then the fourth Mubid questioned him and said-   
<p>"See a green garden full of springs; A strong man with a sickle keen Enters, 
and reaps both dry and green; No word thine utmost anguish wrings."   
<p>And Zal bethought him and replied-   
<p>"Thy word was of a garden green, A reaper with a sickle keen, Who cuts alike 
the fresh and the dry Nor heedeth prayer nor any cry: Time is the reaper, we the 
grass; Pity nor fear his spirit has, But old and young he reaps alike. No rank 
can stay his sickle's strike, No love, but he will leave it lorn, For to this 
end all men are born. Birth opes to all the gate of Life, Death shuts it down on 
love and strife, And Fate, that counts the breath of man, Measures to each a 
reckoned span."   
<p>Then the fifth Mubid questioned him and said-   
<p>"Look how two lofty cypresses Spring up, like reeds, from stormy seas, There 
builds a bird his dwelling-place; Upon the one all night he stays, But swift, 
with the dawn, across he flies; The abandoned tree dries up and dies, While that 
whereon he sets his feet Breathes odours out, surpassing sweet. The one is dead 
for ever and aye, The other lives and blooms alway."   
<p>Then Zal yet again bethought him before he said-   
<p>"Hear of the sea-born cypresses, Where builds a bird, and rests, and flees. 
From the Ram to the Scales the earth o'erpowers, Shadows obscure of the night 
that lowers, But when the Scales' sign it must quit, Darkness and gloom 
o'ermaster it; The sides of heaven thy fable shows Whence grief to man or 
blessing flows, The sun like a bird flies to and fro, Weal with him bringing, 
but leaving woe."   
<p>Then the sixth Mubid questioned him, and it was the last question that he 
asked, and he deemed it the hardest of all to answer. And all men hung upon his 
words and listened to the answer of Zal. And the Mubid said-   
<p>"Builded on a rock I found A town. Men left the gate and chose A thicket on 
the level ground. Soon their soaring mansions rose Lifting roofs that reach the 
moon, Some men slaves, some kings, became, Of their earlier city soon The memory 
died in all. Its name None breathed. But hark! an earthquake; down, Lost in the 
chasm lies the land- Now long they for their rock-built town, Enduring things 
they understand. Seek in thy soul the truth of this; This before kings proclaim, 
I was, If rightly thou the riddle rede, Black earth to musk thou hast changed 
indeed."   
<p>And Zal pondered this riddle but a little while, and then opened his mouth 
and said-   
<p>"The eternal, final world is shown By image of a rock-built town; The thicket 
is our passing life, A place of pleasure and of pain, A world of dreams and 
eager strife, A time for labour, and loss, and gain; This counts thy 
heart-beats, at its will Prolongs their pulse or makes it still. But winds and 
earthquake rouse: a cry Goes up of bitterness and woe, Now we must leave our 

homes below And climb the rocky fastness high. Another reaps our fruit of pain, 
That yet to another leaves his gain; So was it aye, must so remain. Well for us 
if our name endure, Though we shall pass, beloved and pure, For all the evil man 
hath done, Stalks, when he dies, in the sight of the sun; When dust is strown on 
breast and head, Then desolation reigns with dread."   
<p>When Zal had spoken thus the Shah was glad, and an the assembly were amazed, 
and lauded the son of Saum. And the King bade a great banquet be prepared, and 
they drank wine until the world was darkened, and the heads of the drinkers were 
troubled. Then when morn was come Zal prayed that the Shah would dismiss him. 
But Minuchihr said-   
<p>"Not so, abide with me yet another day," and he bade the drums be beaten to 
call together his heroes, for he desired to test Zal also in feats of strength. 
And the Shah sat upon the roof of his house and looked down upon the games, and 
he beheld Zal, the son of Saum, do mighty deeds of prowess. With his arrow did 
he shoot farther and straighter than the rest, and with his spear he pierced all 
shields, and in wrestling he overcame the strongest who had never known defeat. 
When the nobles beheld these doughty deeds they shouted and clapped their hands, 
and Minuchihr loaded Zal with gifts. Then he prepared a reply unto the letter of 
Saum. And he wrote-   
<p>"O my Pehliva, hero of great renown, I have listened to thy desires, and I 
have beheld the youth who is worthy to be thy son. And he hath found favour in 
my sight, and I send him back to thee satisfied. May his enemies be impotent to 
harm him."   
<p>Then when the Shah had given him leave to go, Zal set forth, and he bare his 
head high in the joy of his heart. And when he came before his father and gave 
to him the letter of the Shah, Saum was young again for happiness. Then the 
drums sounded the signal to depart, and the tents were prepared, and a 
messenger, mounted on a fleet dromedary, was sent unto Mihrab to tell him that 
Saum and Zal were setting forth for Cabul. And when Mihrab heard the tidings his 
fears were stilled, and he commanded that his army be clad in festal array. And 
silken standards of bright colour decked the city, and the sounds of trumpets, 
harps, and cymbals filled the air. And Sindokht told the glad tidings to 
Rudabeh, and they made ready the house like unto a paradise. Carpets broidered 
with gold and precious stones did they lay down upon its floors, and set forth 
thrones of ivory and rich carving. And the ground they watered with rose-water 
and wine.   
<p>Then when the guests were come near unto Cabul, Mihrab went forth to meet 
them, and he placed upon the head of Zal a crown of diamonds, and they came into 
the city in triumph. And all the people did homage before them, and Sindokht met 
them at the doors of the King's house, and poured out musk and precious stones 
before them. Then Saum, when he had replied to their homage, smiled, and turned 
to Sindokht and said-   
<p>"How much longer dost thou think to hide Rudabeh from our eyes?"   
<p>And Sindokht said, "What wilt thou give me to see the sun?"   
<p>Then Saum replied, "All that thou wilt, even unto my slaves and my throne, 
will I give to thee."   
<p>Then Sindokht led him within the curtains, and when Saum beheld Rudabeh he 
was struck dumb with wonder, for her beauty exceeded dreams, and he knew not how 
he could find words to praise her. Then he asked of Mihrab that he would give 
unto him her hand, and they concluded an alliance according to custom and the 
law. And the lovers were seated upon a throne, and Mihrab read out the list of 
the gifts, and it was so long the ear did not suffice to hear them. Then they 
repaired unto the banquet, and they feasted seven days without ceasing. And when 
a month had passed Saum went back to Seistan, and Zal and Rudabeh followed after 
him. And speedily did he set forth again to battle, and left the kingdom in the 
hands of his son, and Zal administered it with wisdom and judgment. And Rudabeh 
sat beside him on the throne, and he placed a crown of gold upon her head.   <A 
id=Rustem name=Rustem></a>
<H3>RUSTEM</H3>
<p>Now ere the son of Zal was born, Rudabeh was sore afflicted, and neither by 
day nor night could she find rest. Then Zal in his trouble bethought him of the 
Simurgh, his nurse, and how she had given unto him a feather that he might use 
it in the hour of his need. And he cast the feather into the fire as she had 
commanded, and straightway a sound of rushing wings filled the air, and the sky 
was darkened and the bird of God stood before Zal. And she said unto him-   
<p>"O my son, wherefore art thou troubled, and why are the eyes of this lion wet 
with tears?"   
<p>Then he told her of his sorrow, and she bade him be of good cheer, "For 
verily thy nurse who shielded thee, and reared thee when thy father cast thee 
out, is come yet again to succour thee."   
<p>And she told him how he should act, and when she had done speaking she turned 
her once more towards her nest. But Zal did as she had commanded, and there was 
born to him a son comely of limb. And when Rudabeh beheld the babe, she smiled 
and said-   
<p>"Verily he shall be called Rustem (which, being interpreted, meaneth 
delivered), for I am delivered of my pains."   
<p>And all the land was glad that a son was come unto Zal the hero, and the 
sounds of feasting and joy were heard throughout its breadth.   
<p>Then fleet messengers brought the sweet tidings unto Saum. And they bare with 
them an image of Rustem sewn of silk, whereon were traced the features of this 
lion's whelp, and a club was put into its hands, and it was mounted upon a 
dromedary. Now when Saum beheld the image his heart leaped up within him. He 
poured mountains of gold before the messengers, and gave thanks unto Ormuzd that 
he had suffered his eyes to look upon this child.   
<p>And when eight summers had rolled above their heads, Saum learned that Rustem 
was mighty of stature and fair of mien, and his heart yearned towards him. He 
therefore made ready a mighty host and passed unto Zaboulistan, that he might 
look upon his son. And Rustem rode forth to meet his sire, mounted upon an 
elephant of war, and when he beheld Saum he fell upon his face and craved his 
blessing. And Saum blessed Rustem, the son of Zal.   
<p>Then Rustem spake unto Saum and said, "O Pehliva, I rejoice in that I am 
sprung from thee, for my desires are not after the feast, neither do I covet 
sleep or rest. My heart is fixed upon valour, a horse do I crave and a saddle, a 
coat of mail and a helmet, and my delight is in the arrow. Thine enemies will I 
vanquish, and may my courage be like unto thine."   
<p>And Saum, when he had heard these words, was astonished, and blessed Rustem 
yet again. And his eyes could not cease from gazing upon the face of the boy, 
and he lingered in the land until a moon had run her course.   
<p>Now it befell that when yet two springs had passed, Rustem was awakened from 
his slumber by a mighty roaring that shook the walls of the house, even unto the 
foundation, and a cry went forth that the white elephant of the King had broken 
its chain in fury, and that the housemates were in danger. And Rustem, when he 
learned it, sprang from his bed, and desired of the guards that they should 
suffer him to pass into the court that he might conquer the beast. But the 
guards barred the way from him, saying-   
<p>"How can we answer for it before the King if thou run into danger?"   
<p>But Rustem would not listen to their voice. He forced a passage for himself 
with his mighty arms, with his strong fists he broke down the barriers of the 
door. And when he was without he beheld how that all the warriors were sore 
afraid of the elephant, because that he was mad with rage. And Rustem was 
ashamed for them in his soul, and he ran towards the beast with a loud cry. Then 
the elephant, when he saw him, raised his trunk to strike him, but Rustem beat 
him upon the head with his club, and smote him that he died. And when he had 
done this deed, he returned unto his bed and slept until the morning. But the 
news of his prowess spread throughout the house of the King and far into the 
land, even unto the realms of Saum. And Zal, and all men with him, rejoiced 
because a hero was arisen in Iran.   
<p>Now, while these things were passing in the house of Zal, in the land of 
Zaboulistan, Minuchihr made him ready to pass from the world, for he had reached 
twice sixty years. He called before him Nauder his son, and gave him wise 
counsels, and exhorted him that he should ever walk in the paths of wisdom. And 
he bade him rest his throne upon the strength of Saum and Zal, and the child 
that was sprung from their loins. Then when he had spoken, Minuchihr closed his 
eyes and sighed, and there remained of him only a memory in the world.   
<p>But Nauder forgot the counsels of his father. He vexed the land and reigned 
in anger, and cruel deeds were committed in his name, so that the people rose up 
and cried against the King. And men of might came unto Saum and laid before him 
their plaints, and the petitions of the people, and they prayed that he would 
wrest the crown from the head of Nauder, and place it upon his own. But Saum was 
sore grieved when he had heard these words, and he spake, saying-   
<p>"Not so, for it beseemeth me not to put out my hand after the crown, for 
Nauder is of the race of the Kaianides, and unto them is given majesty and 
might."   
<p>Then he girt his sword about his loins, and took with him a host, and rode 
before the face of the Shah. And when he was come unto him, Saum exhorted him 
with prayers and tears that he would turn him from the paths of evil. And Nauder 
listened unto the voice of Saum the Pehliva, and joy was abroad once more.   
<p>But the tidings spread, even into Turan, that Minuchihr the just was 
departed, and that the hand of Nauder was heavy upon the land. And Poshang, who 
was of the race of Tur, heard the news thereof with gladness, for he deemed that 
the time was ripe to remember the vengeance that was due unto the blood of his 
sire. Therefore he called about him his warriors, and bade them go forth to war 
against Iran, saying the time was come to avenge his father and draw unto 
himself the heritage. And while his son Afrasiyab made ready the host to fulfil 
the desire of his father, there spread the news that Saum the Pehliva had been 
gathered unto the dust, and that Zal tarried in his house to build him a tomb. 
And the news gave courage unto Afrasiyab and his men, and they made haste to 
gain the frontier.   
<p>But the grandson of Feridoun had learned of their coming, and he prepared him 
to meet the foes of his land. Then he sent forth an army that overshadowed the 
earth in its progress. But the army of Afrasiyab was great also, and it covered 
the ground like unto ants and locusts. And both hosts pitched their tents in the 
plains of Dehstan, and made them ready for the fight. And the horses neighed 
loud, and the pawing of their hoofs shook the deep places of the earth, and the 
dust of their trampling uprose even unto heaven. Then when they had put their 
men into array, they fell upon each other, and for two days did they rage in 
fierce combat, neither did the victory lean to either side. And the clamour and 
confusion were mighty, and earth and sky seemed blended into one. And the 
carnage was great, and blood flowed like water, and heads fell from their trunks 
like unto autumn leaves that are withered. But on the third day it came about 
that the upper hand was given unto the men of Turan, and Nauder the King, and 
the flower of his army with him, fell into the hands of the foe.   
<p>Then Afrasiyab cut off the head of Nauder the Shah, and sat himself down upon 
the throne of light. And he proclaimed himself lord of Iran, and required of all 
men that they should do him homage, and pour gifts before his face. But the 
people would not listen unto his voice, and they sent messengers into Seistan, 
and craved counsel of the Pehliva in their distress. And Zal, when he heard 
their tidings, cast aside the sorrow for Saum his father, and girded his loins 
in enmity against the son of Tur. And he bade the Iranians choose out Zew, the 
son of Thamasp, of the blood of Feridoun, of wisdom in speech, that he should 
rule over them on the throne of the Kaianides. And the people did as Zal 
commanded.   
<p>Now the throne of Feridoun grew young again under the sway of Zew. With power 
did he beat back the host of Turan, a covenant of peace did he wring from their 
hands. And it was written that the Jihun should divide the lands, and that the 
power of Zal the Pehliva should end where men take up their abode in tents. And 
Zew ruled rightly in the sight of Ormuzd, and God gave unto the land the key of 
abundance. Yet few were the years that he commanded with equity, and Garshasp 
his son reigned in his stead. But neither to him was it given to reign long with 
glory, and bitter fruit sprouted yet again from the tree of misfortune. For the 
throne of the Kaianides was empty, and Afrasiyab, when he learned thereof, 
followed the counsels of Poshang his father, and hurried him unto the land of 
Iran, that he might place himself upon the seat of power. And all the men of 
Iran, when they learned thereof, were sore afraid, and they turned them once 
again unto the son of Saum. And they spake unto him hard words, and heaped 
reproaches upon him that he had not averted these dangers from their heads. And 
Zal in his heart smiled at their ingratitude and lipwisdom, but he also sorrowed 
with them and with his land. And he spake, saying-   
<p>"I have ever done for you what was fitting and right, and all my life have I 
feared no enemy save only old age. But that enemy is now upon me, therefore I 
charge you that ye look unto Rustem to deliver you. Howbeit he shall be backed 
by the counsels of his father."   
<p>Then he called before him his son, who was yet of tender age, and he said 
unto him-   
<p>"O my son, thy lips still smell of milk, and thy heart should go out to 
pleasure. But the days are grave, and Iran looketh unto thee in its danger. I 
must send thee forth to cope with heroes."   
<p>And Rustem answered and said, "Thou knowest, O my father, that my desires are 
rather after war than pleasures. Give unto me, therefore, a steed of strength 
and the mace of Saum thy father, and suffer that I go out to meet the hosts of 
Ahriman."   
<p>Then Zal's heart laughed within him when he heard these words of manhood. And 
he commanded that all the flocks of horses, both from Zaboulistan and Cabul, be 
brought before his son, that he might choose from their midst his steed of 
battle. And they were passed in order before Rustem, and he laid upon the backs 
of each his hand of might to test them if they could bear his weight of valour. 
And the horses shuddered as they bent beneath his grasp, and sank upon their 
haunches in weakness. And thus did he do with them all in turn, until he came 
unto the flocks of Cabul. Then he perceived in their midst a mare mighty and 
strong, and there followed after her a colt like to its mother, with the chest 
and shoulders of a lion. And in strength it seemed like an elephant, and in 
colour it was as rose leaves that have been scattered upon a saffron ground. Now 
Rustem, when he had tested the colt with his eyes, made a running knot in his 
cord and threw it about the beast. And he caught the colt in the snare, though 
the mare defended it mightily. Then the keeper of the flock came before Rustem 
and said-   
<p>"O youth puissant and tall, take not, I counsel thee, the horse of 
another."   
<p>And Rustem answered him and asked, "To whom then pertaineth this steed? I see 
no mark upon its flanks."   
<p>And the keeper said, "We know not its master, but rumours are rife anent it 
throughout the land, and men name it the Rakush of Rustem. And I warn thee, the 
mother will never permit thee to ride on it. Three years has it been ready for 
the saddle, but none would she suffer to mount thereon."   
<p>Then Rustem, when he heard these words, swung himself upon the colt with a 
great bound. And the mare, when she saw it, ran at him and would have pulled him 
down, but when she had heard his voice she suffered it. And the rose-coloured 
steed bore Rustem along the plains like unto the wind. Then when he was 
returned, the son of Zal spake and said to the keeper-   
<p>"I pray thee, tell unto me what is the price of this dragon?"   
<p>But the keeper replied, "If thou be Rustem, mount him, and retrieve the 
sorrows of Iran. For his price is the land of Iran, and seated upon him thou 
wilt save the world."   
<p>And Rustem rejoiced in Rakush (whose name, being interpreted, meaneth the 
lightning), and Zal rejoiced with him, and they made them ready to stand against 
Afrasiyab.   
<p>Now it was in the time of roses, and the meadows smiled with verdure, when 
Zal led forth his hosts against the offspring of Tur. And the standard of Kawah 
streamed upon the breeze, and Mihrab marched on the left, and Gustahem marched 
on the right, and Zal went in the midst of the men, but Rustem went at the head 
of all. And there followed after him a number like to the sands of the sea, and 
the sounds of cymbals and bells made a noise throughout the land like unto the 
day of judgment, when the earth shall cry unto the dead, "Arise." And they 
marched in order even unto the shores of the river Rai, and the two armies were 
but some farsangs apart.   
<p>Albeit, when Afrasiyab heard that Rustem and Zal were come out against him, 
he was in nowise dismayed, for he said, "The son is but a boy, and the father is 
old; it will not, therefore, be hard for me to keep my power in Iran." And he 
made ready his warriors with gladness of heart.   
<p>But Zal, when he had drawn up his army in battle array, spake unto them, 
saying-   
<p>"O men valiant in fight, we are great in number, but there is wanting to us a 
chief, for we are without the counsels of a Shah, and verily no labour 
succeedeth when the head is lacking. But rejoice, and be not downcast in your 
hearts, for a Mubid hath revealed unto me that there yet liveth one of the race 
of Feridoun to whom pertaineth the throne, and that he is a youth wise and 
brave."   
<p>And when he had thus spoken, he turned him to Rustem and said-   
<p>"I charge thee, O my son, depart in haste for the Mount Alberz, neither tarry 
by the way. And wend thee unto Kai Kobad, and say unto him that his army 
awaiteth him, and that the throne of the Kaianides is empty."   
<p>And Rustem, when he had heard his father's command, touched with his 
eyelashes the ground before his feet, and straightway departed. In his hand he 
bare a mace of might, and under him was Rakush the swift of foot. And he rode 
till he came within sight of the Mount Alberz, whereon had stood the cradle of 
his father. Then he beheld at its foot a house beauteous like unto that of a 
king. And around it was spread a garden whence came the sounds of running 
waters, and trees of tall stature uprose therein, and under their shade, by a 
gurgling rill, there stood a throne, and a youth, fair like to the moon, was 
seated thereon. And round about him leaned knights girt with red sashes of 
power, and you would have said it was a paradise for perfume and beauty.   
<p>Now when those within the garden beheld the son of Zal ride by, they came out 
unto him and said-   
<p>"O Pehliva, it behoveth us not to let thee go farther before thou hast 
permitted us to greet thee as our guest. We pray thee, therefore, descend from 
off thy horse and drink the cup of friendship in our house."   
<p>But Rustem said, "Not so, I thank you, but suffer that I may pass unto the 
mountain with an errand that brooketh no delay. For the borders of Iran are 
encircled by the enemy, and the throne is empty of a king. Wherefore I may not 
stay to taste of wine."   
<p>Then they answered him, "If thou goest unto the mount, tell us, we pray thee, 
thy mission, for unto us is it given to guard its sides."   
<p>And Rustem replied, "I seek there a king of the seed of Feridoun, who 
cleansed the world of the abominations of Zohak, a youth who reareth high his 
head. I pray ye, therefore, if ye know aught of Kai Kobad, that ye give me 
tidings where I may find him."   
<p>Then the youth that sat upon the throne opened his mouth and said, "Kai Kobad 
is known unto me, and if thou wilt enter this garden and rejoice my soul with 
thy presence I will give thee tidings concerning him."   
<p>When Rustem heard these words he sprang from off his horse and came within 
the gates. And the youth took his hand and led him unto the steps of the throne. 
Then he mounted it yet again, and when he had filled a cup with wine, he pledged 
the guest within his gates. Then he gave a cup unto Rustem, and questioned him 
wherefore he sought for Kai Kobad, and at whose desire he was come forth to find 
him. And Rustem told him of the Mubids, and how that his father had sent him 
with all speed to pray the young King that he would be their Shah, and lead the 
host against the enemies of Iran. Then the youth, when he had listened to an 
end, smiled and said-   
<p>"O Pehliva, behold me, for verily I am Kai Kobad of the race of 
Feridoun!"   
<p>And Rustem, when he had heard these words, fell on the ground before his 
feet, and saluted him Shah. Then the King raised him, and commanded that the 
slaves should give him yet another cup of wine, and he bore it to his lips in 
honour of Rustem, the son of Zal, the son of Saum, the son of Neriman. And they 
gave a cup also unto Rustem, and he cried-   
<p>"May the Shah live for ever!" Then instruments of music rent the air, and joy 
spread over all the assembly. But when silence was fallen yet again, Kai Kobad 
opened his mouth and said-   
<p>"Hearken, O my knights, unto the dream that I had dreamed, and ye will know 
wherefore I called upon you this day to stand in majesty about my throne. For in 
my sleep I beheld two falcons white of wing, and they came out unto me from 
Iran, and in their beaks they bare a sunny crown. And the crown they placed upon 
my head. And behold now is Rustem come out unto me like to a white bird, and his 
father, the nursling of a bird, hath sent him, and they have given unto me the 
crown of Iran."   
<p>And Rustem, when he had heard this dream, said, "Surely thy vision was given 
unto thee of God! But now, I pray thee, up and tarry no longer, for the land of 
Iran groaneth sore and awaiteth thee with much travail."   
<p>So Kai Kobad listened to the desires of Rustem, and swung him upon his steed 
of war; and they rode day and night, until they came down from the hills unto 
the green plains that are watered by murmuring streams. And Rustem brought the 
King safely through the outposts of the enemy; and when the night was fallen, he 
led him within the tents of Zal, and none knew that he was come save only the 
Mubids. For seven days did they hold counsel together, and on the eighth the 
message of the stars was received with joy. And Zal made ready a throne of ivory 
and a banquet, and the crown of Iran was placed upon the head of the young Shah. 
Then the nobles came and did homage before him, and they revelled in wine till 
the night was far spent. And they prayed him that he would make him ready to 
lead them against the Turks. And Kai Kobad mustered the army and did as they 
desired.   
<p>And soon the battle raged hot and strong many days, and deeds of valour were 
done on either side; but the men of Turan could not stand against the men of 
Iran, neither could the strength of Rustem be broken. For he put forth the power 
of a lion, and his shadow extended for miles. And from that day men named him 
Tehemten (which being interpreted, meaneth the strong-limbed), for he did deeds 
of prowess in the sight of men. And Afrasiyab was discomfited, and fled before 
him, and his army followed after, and their hearts were bruised and full of 
care.   
<p>But the Iranians, when they beheld that their foes had vanished before them, 
turned them unto Kai Kobad and did homage before his throne. And Kai Kobad 
celebrated the victory with much pomp, as is the manner of kings; and he placed 
Rustem upon his right hand and Zal upon his left, and they feasted and made them 
merry with wine.   
<p>In the meantime Afrasiyab returned him unto Poshang his father, who was of 
the race of Tur. And he came before him right sorrowful and spake, saying-   
<p>"O King, whose name is glorious, thou didst evil to provoke this war. The 
land which Feridoun the great did give in ancient time unto Tur the valiant, it 
hath been delivered unto thee, and the partition was just. Why, therefore, 
seekest thou to enlarge thy border? Verily I say, if thou haste not to make 
peace with Iran, Kai Kobad will send out against us an army from the four 
quarters of the earth, and they will subdue us, and by our own act we shall make 
the land too narrow for us. For the world is not delivered of the race of Irij, 
and the noxious poison hath not been converted into honey. For when one dieth 
another taketh his place, and never do they leave the world without a master. 
And there is arisen of the race of Saum a warrior called Rustem, and none can 
withstand him. He hath broken the power of thine host, and the world hath not 
seen his like for stoutness; and withal he is but little more than a weanling. 
Ponder therefore, O King, how shall it be when he may be come to years of 
vigour. Surely I am a man who desireth to possess the world, the stay of thine 
army, and thy refuge in danger, but before this boy my power fadeth like unto 
the mists that rise above the hills."   
<p>When the King of Turan had listened to these words, the tears of bitterness 
fell from his eyes. Then he called before him a scribe and he bade him write a 
letter unto Kai Kobad, the Shah. And the scribe adorned it with many colours and 
fair designs. And the scribe wrote-   
<p>"In the name of Ormuzd, the ruler of the sun and moon, greeting and 
salutation unto Kai Kobad the gracious from the meanest of his servants. Listen 
unto me, O valiant Shah, and ponder the words that I shall write. May grace fall 
upon the soul of Feridoun, who wove the woof of our race! Why should we any 
longer hold the world in confusion? That which he fixed, surely it was right, 
for he parted the world with equity, and we do wrong before him when we depart 
from the grooves that he hath shaped. I pray thee, therefore, let us no longer 
speak of Tur and his evil acts unto Irij, for if Irij was the cause of our 
hates, surely by Minuchihr hath he been avenged. Let us return, then, within the 
bounds that Feridoun hath blest, and let us part the world anew, as it was 
parted for Tur, and Selim, and Irij. For wherefore should we seek the land of 
another, since in the end each will receive in heritage a spot no larger than 
his body? If then Kai Kobad will listen unto my prayer, let the Jihun be the 
boundary between us, and none of my people shall behold its waters, nay, not 
even in a dream, neither shall any Iranian cross its floods, save only in 
amity."   
<p>And the King put his seal upon the letter and sent it unto Kai Kobad, and the 
messenger bare with him rich gifts of jewels and steeds of Araby. And when Kai 
Kobad had read the letter he smiled in his spirit and said-   
<p>"Verily not my people sought out this war but Afrasiyab, who deemed that he 
could wrest unto himself the crown of Iran, and could subdue the masterless land 
unto his will. And he hath but followed in the footsteps of Tur his father, for 
even as he robbed the throne of Irij, so did Afrasiyab take from it Nauder the 
Shah. And I say to you that I need not make peace with you because of any fear, 
but I will do it because war is not pleasing unto me. I will give unto you, 
therefore, the farther side of the river, and it shall be a boundary between us, 
and I pray that Afrasiyab may find rest within his borders."   
<p>And Kai Kobad did according to his word. He drew up a fresh covenant between 
them, and planted a new tree in the garden of power. And the messenger took the 
writing unto Poshang, King of Turan, and Kai Kobad proclaimed that there was 
peace throughout the land.   
<p>Now for the space of an hundred years did Kai Kobad rule over Iran, and he 
administered his realm with clemency, and the earth was quiet before him, and he 
gat his people great honour, and I ask of you what king can be likened unto him? 
But when this time had passed, his strength waned, and he knew that a green leaf 
was about to fade. So he called before him Kai Kaous his son, and gave unto him 
counsels many and wise. And when he had done speaking he bade them make ready 
his grave, and he exchanged the palace for the tomb. And thus endeth the history 
of Kai Kobad the glorious. It behoveth us now to speak of his son.
