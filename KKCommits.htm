Whilom the fancy seized upon the Shah of Iran that he would visit his empire, and look face to face upon his vassals, and exact their tribute. So he passed  from Turan into China, and from Mikran into Berberistan. And wheresoever he  passed men did homage before him, for the bull cannot wage battle with the lion.  But it could not remain thus for ever, and already there sprang forth thorns in  the garden of roses. For while the fortunes of the world thus prospered, a  chieftain raised the standard of revolt in Egypt, and the people of the land  turned them from the gates of submission unto Iran. And there was joined unto  them the King of Hamaveran, who desired to throw off the yoke of Persia. But Kai  Kaous, when the tidings thereof came unto him, got ready his army and marched  against the rebels. And when he came before them, their army, that had seemed  invincible, was routed, and the King of Hamaveran was foremost to lay down his  arms and ask pardon of his Shah. And Kai Kaous granted his petition, and the  King departed joyously from out his presence. Then one of those who stood about  the Shah said unto him-    
<p>"Is it known to thee, O Shah, that this King hideth behind his curtains a 
daughter of beauty? It would beseem my lord that he should take this moon unto 
himself for wife."   
<p>And Kai Kaous answered, "Thy counsel is good, and I will therefore send 
messengers unto her father, and demand of him that he give me his daughter as 
tribute, and to cement the peace that hath been made between us."   
<p>When the King of Hamaveran heard this message his heart was filled with gall, 
and his head was heavy with sorrow, and he murmured in his spirit that Kai 
Kaous, who owned the world, should desire to take from him his chiefest 
treasure. And he hid not his grief from the Shah in his answer, but he wrote 
also that he knew it behoved him to do the thing that Kai Kaous desired. Then in 
his distress he called before him Sudaveh his daughter, whom he loved, and he 
told her all his troubles, and bade her counsel him how he should act. For he 
said-   
<p>"If I lose thee, the light of my life is gone out. Yet how may I stand 
against the Shah?"   
<p>And Sudaveh replied, "If there be no remedy, I counsel thee to rejoice at 
that which cannot be changed."   
<p>Now when her father heard these words he knew that she was not afflicted 
concerning that which was come about. So he sent for the envoy of Kai Kaous and 
assented unto his demands, and they concluded an alliance according to the forms 
of the land. Then when the King had poured gifts before the messenger, and 
feasted him with wine, he sent forth an escort to bear his daughter unto the 
tents of the Shah. And the young moon went forth in a litter, and she was robed 
in garbs of splendour, and when Kai Kaous beheld her loveliness he was struck 
dumb for very joy. Then he raised Sudaveh unto the throne beside him, and named 
her worthy to be his spouse. And they were glad in each other, and rejoiced; but 
all was not to be well thus quickly.   
<p>For the King of Hamaveran was sore in his heart that the light of his life 
was gone from him, and he cast about in his spirit how he should regain her unto 
himself. And when she had been gone but seven days, he sent forth a messenger 
unto Kai Kaous and entreated him that he would come and feast within his gates, 
so that all the land might rejoice in their alliance.   
<p>When Sudaveh heard this message her mind misgave her, and she feared evil. 
Wherefore she counselled the Shah that he should abstain from this feast. But 
Kai Kaous would not listen unto the fears of Sudaveh, he would not give ear unto 
her warning. Wherefore he went forth unto the city of the King of Hamaveran, and 
made merry with him many days. And the King caused gifts to be rained down upon 
Kai Kaous, and he flattered him, and cozened his vanity, and he made much of his 
men, and he darkened their wits with fair words and sweet wine. Then when he had 
lulled their fears, and caused them to forget wherefore and why and all 
knowledge of misfortune, he fell upon them and bound them with strong chains, 
and overthrew their glories and their thrones. And Kai Kaous did he send unto a 
fortress whose head touched the sky and whose foot was planted in the ocean. 
Then he sent forth a strong band into the camp of Iran, and veiled women went 
with them, and he charged them that they bring back Sudaveh unto his arms.   
<p>Now when Sudaveh saw the men and the women that went with them she guessed 
what was come about, and she cried aloud and tore her robes in anguish. And when 
they had brought her before her father she reproved him for his treachery, and 
she sware that none should part her from Kai Kaous, even though he were hidden 
in a tomb. Then the King was angered when he saw that her heart was taken from 
him and given to the Shah, and he bade that she be flung into the same prison as 
her lord. And Sudaveh was glad at his resolve, and she went into the dungeon 
with a light heart, and she seated herself beside the Shah, and served him and 
comforted him, and they bore the weight of captivity together.   
<p>After these things were come about, the Iranians, because that their Shah was 
held captive, returned unto Iran much discomfited. And when the news spread that 
the throne was empty many would have seized thereon. And Afrasiyab, when he 
learned it, straightway forgot hunger and sleep, and marched a strong army 
across the border. And he laid waste the land of Iran, and men, women, and 
children fell into bondage at his hands, and the world was darkened unto the 
kingdom of light. Then some arose and went before the son of Zal to crave his 
help in this sore need, saying unto him-   
<p>"Be thou our shield against misfortune, and deliver us from affliction, for 
the glory of the Kaianides is vanished, and the land which was a paradise is one 
no more."   
<p>Now Rustem, when he heard the news, was grieved for the land, but he was 
angered also against the Shah that he had thus once again run into danger. Yet 
he told the messengers that he would seek to deliver Kai Kaous, and that when he 
had done so he would remember the land of Iran. And forthwith he sent a secret 
messenger unto Kai Kaous, a man subtle and wise, and caused him to say unto the 
Shah-   
<p>"An army cometh forth from Iran to redeem thee. Rejoice, therefore, and cast 
aside thy fears."   
<p>And he also sent a writing unto the King of Hamaveran, and the writing was 
filled with threats, and spake only of maces and swords and combat. And Rustem 
loaded the King with reproaches because of his treachery, and he bade him 
prepare to meet Rustem the mighty.   
<p>When the King of Hamaveran had read this letter his head was troubled, and he 
defied Rustem, and threatened him that if he came forth against him he should 
meet at his hands the fate of the Shah. But Rustem only smiled when he heard 
this answer, and he said-   
<p>"Surely this man is foolish, or Ahriman hath filled his mind with smoke."   
<p>Then he mounted Rakush, and made ready to go into Hamaveran, and a vast train 
of warriors went after him. And the King of Hamaveran, when he saw it sent forth 
his army against him. But the army were afraid when they beheld Rustem and his 
might of mien, his mace, and his strong arms and lion chest, and their hearts 
departed from out their bodies, and they fled from before his sight, and 
returned them unto the King of Hamaveran.   
<p>Now the King was seated in the midst of his counsellors, and when he saw the 
army thus scattered before they had struck a blow, his heart misgave him, and he 
craved counsel of his chiefs. Then they counselled him that he should cast about 
him for allies. So the King of Hamaveran sent messengers of entreaty unto the 
Kings of Egypt and Berberistan, and they listened to his prayers, and sent out a 
great army unto his aid. And they drew them up against Rustem, and the armies 
stretched for two leagues in length, and you would have said the handful of 
Rustem could not withstand their force. Yet Rustem bade his men be not 
discomfited, and rest their hopes on God. Then he fell upon the armies of the 
Kings like to a flame that darteth forth, and the ground was drenched with gore, 
and on all sides rolled heads that were severed from their bodies; and 
wheresoever Rakush and Rustem showed themselves, there was great havoc made in 
the ranks. And ere the evening was come, the Kings of Egypt and Berberistan were 
his captives; and when the sun was set, the King of Hamaveran knew that a day of 
ill fortune was ended. So he sent forth to crave mercy at the hands of the 
Pehliva. And Rustem listened to his voice, and said that he would stay his hand 
if the King would restore unto him Kai Kaous, and the men and treasures that 
were his. Then the King of Hamaveran granted the just requests of Rustem. So Kai 
Kaous was led forth from his prison, and Sudaveh came with him. And when they 
beheld him, the King of Hamaveran and his allies declared their allegiance unto 
him, and they marched with him into Iran to go out against Afrasiyab. And 
Sudaveh went with the army in a litter clothed with fair stuffs, and encrusted 
with wood of aloes. And she was veiled that none might behold her beauty, and 
she went with the men like to the sun when he marcheth behind a cloud.   
<p>Now when Kai Kaous was come home again unto his land, he sent a writing unto 
Afrasiyab. And he said-   
<p>"Quit, I command thee, the land of Iran, nor seek to enlarge thyself at my 
cost. For knowest thou not that Iran is mine, and that the world pertaineth unto 
me?"   
<p>But Afrasiyab answered, "The words which thou dost write are not becoming 
unto a man such as thou, who didst covet Mazandaran and the countries round 
about. If thou wert satisfied with Iran, wherefore didst thou venture afield? 
And I say unto thee, Iran is mine, because of Tur my forefather, and because I 
subdued it under my hand."   
<p>When Kai Kaous had heard these words he knew that Afrasiyab would not yield 
save unto force. So he drew up his army into array, and they marched out to meet 
the King of Turan. And Afrasiyab met them with a great host, and the sound of 
drums and cymbals filled the air. And great was the strife and bloody, but 
Rustem broke the force of Turan, and the fortunes of its army were laid to rest 
upon the field of battle. And Afrasiyab, when he beheld it, was discomfited, and 
his spirit boiled over like to new wine that fermenteth. And he mourned over his 
army and the warriors that he had trained, and he conjured those that remained 
to make yet another onslaught, and he spake fair promises unto them if they 
would deliver unto his hands Rustem, the Pehliva. And he said-   
<p>"Whoever shall bring him alive before me, I will give unto him a kingdom and 
an umbrella, and the hand of my daughter in marriage."   
<p>And the Turks, when they heard these words, girded them yet again for 
resistance. But it availed them nought, for the Iranians were mightier than 
they, and they watered the earth with their blood until the ground was like a 
rose. And the fortunes of the Turks were as a light put out, and Afrasiyab fled 
before the face of Rustem, and the remnant of his army went after him.   
<p>Then Kai Kaous seated himself once more upon his throne, and men were glad 
that there was peace. And the Shah opened the doors of justice and splendour, 
and all men did that which was right, and the wolf turned him away from the 
lamb, and there was gladness through all the length of Iran. And the Shah gave 
thanks unto Rustem that he had aided him yet again, and he named him Jahani 
Pehliva, which being interpreted meaneth the champion of the world, and he 
called him the source of his happiness. Then he busied himself with building 
mighty towers and palaces, and the land of Iran was made fair at his hands, and 
all was well once more within its midst.   
<p>But Ahriman the wakeful was not pleased thereat, and he pondered how he could 
once again arouse the ambition of the Shah. So he held counsel with his Devs 
how they might turn the heart of Kai Kaous from the right path. And one among 
them said-   
<p>"Suffer that I go before the Shah, and I will do thy behest."   
<p>And Ahriman suffered it. Then the Dev took upon him the form of a youth, and 
in his hand he held a cluster of roses, and he presented them unto the Shah, and 
he kissed the ground before his feet. And when Kai Kaous had given him leave to 
speak he opened his mouth and said-   
<p>"O Shah, live for ever! though such is thy might and majesty that the vault 
of heaven alone should be thy throne. All the world is submissive before thee, 
and I can bethink me but of one thing that is lacking unto thy glory."   
<p>Then Kai Kaous questioned him of this one thing, and the Dev said-   
<p>"It is that thou knowest not the nature of the sun and moon, nor wherefore 
the planets roll, neither the secret causes that set them in motion. Thou art 
master of all the earth, therefore shouldst thou not make the heavens also 
obedient to thy will?"   
<p>When Kai Kaous heard these words of guile his mind was dimmed, and he forgot 
that man cannot mount unto the skies, and he pondered without ceasing how he 
could fly unto the stars and inquire into their secrets. And he consulted many 
wise men in his trouble, but none could aid him. But at last it came about that 
a certain man taught him how he could perchance accomplish his designs. And Kai 
Kaous did according to his instructions. He built him a framework of aloe-wood, 
and at the four corners thereof he placed javelins upright, and on their points 
he put the flesh of goats. Then he chose out four eagles strong of wing, and 
bound them unto the corners of this chariot. And when it was done, Kai Kaous 
seated himself in the midst thereof with much pomp. And the eagles, when they 
smelt the flesh, desired after it, and they flapped their wings and raised 
themselves, and raised the framework with them. And they struggled sore, but 
they could not attain unto the meat; but ever as they struggled they bore aloft 
with them Kai Kaous and the throne whereon he sat. And so long as their hunger 
lasted, they strove after the prey. But at length their strength would hold no 
longer, and they desisted from the attempt. And behold! as they desisted the 
fabric fell back to earth, and the shock thereof was great. And but for Ormuzd 
Kai Kaous would have perished in the presumption of his spirit.   
<p>Now the eagles had borne the Shah even unto the desert of Cathay, and there 
was no man to succour him, and he suffered from the pangs of hunger, and there 
was nothing to assuage his longing, neither could his thirst be stilled. And he 
was alone, and sorrowful and shamed in his soul that he had yet again brought 
derision upon Iran. And he prayed to God in his trouble, and entreated pardon 
for his sins.   
<p>While Kai Kaous thus strove with repentance, Rustem learned tidings of him, 
and he set out with an army to seek him. And when he had found him he gave rein 
unto his anger, and he rebuked him for his follies, and he said-   
<p>"Hath the world seen the like of this man? Hath a more foolish head sat upon 
the throne of Iran? Ye would say there were no brains within this skull, or that 
not one of its thoughts was good. Kai Kaous is like a thing that is possessed, 
and every wind beareth him away. Thrice hast thou now fallen into mishap, and 
who can tell whether thy spirit hath yet learned wisdom? And it will be a 
reproach unto Iran all her days that a king puffed up with idle pride was seated 
upon her throne, a man who deemed in his folly that he could mount unto the 
skies, and visit the sun and moon, and count the stars one by one. I entreat of 
thee to bethink thee of thy forefathers, and follow in their steps, and rule the 
land in equity, neither rush after these mad adventures."   
<p>When Kai Kaous had listened to the bitter words spoken by Rustem, he was 
bowed down in his spirit and ashamed before him in his soul. And when at last he 
opened his mouth it was to utter words of humility. And he said unto Rustem-   
<p>"Surely that which thou speakest, it is true." Then he suffered himself to be 
led back unto his palace, and many days and nights did he lie in the dust before 
God, and it was long before he held him worthy to mount again upon his throne. 
But when he deemed that God had forgiven him, he seated him upon it once again. 
In humility did he mount it, and he filled it in wisdom. And henceforth he ruled 
the land with justice, and he did that which was right in the sight of God, and 
bathed his face with the waters of sincerity. And kings and rulers did homage 
before him, and forgot the follies that he had done, and Kai Kaous grew worthy 
of the throne of light. And Iran was exalted at his hands, and power and 
prosperity increased within its borders.
